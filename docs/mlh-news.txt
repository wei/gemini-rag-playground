<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have some big news to share today: </span><b>Major League Hacking has acquired DEV (dev.to)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the developer community platform where millions of developers share technical knowledge, learn from each other, and grow together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the biggest moves in MLH&#8217;s 12-year history, and it&#8217;s been a long time coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ben Halpern, Jess Lee, and Peter Frank started DEV almost a decade ago, they wanted to build something the internet didn&#8217;t have enough of: a developer community built on generosity instead of gatekeeping. A place where people didn’t just ask questions, but actually helped each other. Over the years, DEV grew into a community of more than 3 million developers learning in public, sharing expert advice, and supporting one another in their journeys. It&#8217;s become one of the most trusted spaces in tech, and anyone who&#8217;s spent time on the platform knows why. The culture Ben, Jess, and Peter built is special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At MLH, we&#8217;ve been building something complementary. Our developer programs (like the Hackathon League, the MLH Fellowship, and much more) are where developers learn by doing: picking up a tool, creating something real with it, breaking it, trying again. Between our in-person events and programs, MLH has served more than 1.5 million developers across nearly 100 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DEV is the library, MLH is the lab. One is where knowledge gets shared, organized, and preserved. The other is where you get your hands dirty and prove you can actually build. Together, MLH and DEV will reach approximately 5 million developers worldwide. These two community-first platforms have been orbiting each other for years, and we&#8217;re thrilled to finally bring them together.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Now Is The Right Time To Combine MLH &amp; DEV’s Powers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;ve spent years honing your craft as a developer, the value of your skills has grown exponentially over the last year. The judgment, taste, and architectural thinking you&#8217;ve built over a career are exactly the skills that matter most when AI can handle the boilerplate. The ceiling on what you can build has never been higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the floor is rising. People who never would have written a line of code (or called themself a developer) are building real software with AI. More software creators, building more things, tackling more problems. The craft of software development isn&#8217;t shrinking. It&#8217;s expanding. The number of people who can build software is about to grow by an order of magnitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when everyone can build, the skills that matter change. AI generates the bricks, but you still have to build the house. Taste, judgment, knowing what to build, which tools to trust, how to evaluate whether the output is actually good. Those skills don&#8217;t come from a tutorial. They develop by building real things alongside other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And traditional institutions can&#8217;t keep up. By the time a curriculum gets approved, the technology is already six months out of date. The old developer infrastructure was built for a world where people needed answers to technical questions. AI commoditized that. But the need for a developer community didn&#8217;t disappear. It shifted. People don&#8217;t need a database of answers anymore. They need somewhere to develop judgment and learn and build alongside others in a trusted space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, MLH and DEV are building the core community infrastructure of the next era of technology.</span></p>
<h2><b>What&#8217;s Changing (And What&#8217;s Not) For Both Communities</b></h2>
<p><b>DEV will continue to be the community its members know and trust.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The culture that Ben, Jess, and Peter built is exactly why we wanted to do this, and we&#8217;re committed to protecting it. We&#8217;re here to invest in DEV and help it grow, not to change what makes it special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forem, the open source software that powers DEV, will also continue to evolve. This acquisition actually helps clarify the relationship between the organization and the software. We&#8217;re working toward a structure that supports Forem&#8217;s independence so it can serve the broader open source community on its own terms. More on that soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What IS changing is that MLH and DEV can now do things together that neither could do alone. The lab and the library, connected. You experiment with a new platform or tool at an MLH hackathon. You write about what you learned on DEV. That knowledge becomes searchable, permanent, useful to the next person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re shipping your first project or you&#8217;re a senior engineer picking up AI skills for the first time, you&#8217;re welcome here. In the AI era, everyone is a beginner again at some point. MLH and DEV, together, are the place where that&#8217;s not just okay, but encouraged.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking Forward To A Future of Software Creators</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is about to have a lot more builders. They&#8217;re going to need a place to learn, to experiment, to develop taste and judgment, and to find their aspirational figures and their collaborators. That&#8217;s what MLH and DEV are building together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you and congratulations to Ben, Jess, Peter, and everyone who built DEV into the community it is today. And thank you to our MLH community for continuing to show up, build things, and support each other. You&#8217;re the reason we get to do this work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Hacking,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon, Swift, and the entire MLH+DEV team</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. If you want to learn more about the acquisition or the future of MLH and DEV, my co-founder and our CEO Swift will be hosting an Ask Me Anything (AMA) with me (Jon) and the DEV founders (Peter, Ben, and Jess) on <a href="https://twitch.tv/mlh">MLH’s Twitch channel</a> on February 19 at 11:30am ET. We&#8217;ll be answering questions from the community live. We hope to see you there!</span></em></p>

<p>Hackathons accelerate career trajectories by inspiring the next generation of software creators with hands-on training and community. Starting out as a developer is less about landing the first job and more about finding that initial spark. That one moment of pure curiosity that makes you want to tinker and build. <a href="http://www.mlh.com">Major League Hacking</a> is here to help that spark really catch fire.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Hackathons Foster Self-Discovery</h1>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackathons aren&#8217;t just coding sprints – they&#8217;re playgrounds where future developers discover their own creative voices. In these buzzing, collaborative spaces, you learn what it truly means to be an engineer by working alongside others, pushing through a tight deadline, and seeing a wild idea turn into a real thing, sometimes overnight. Those intense, eye opening weekends are often the first major step that opens doors to amazing things down the road.</span></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">How Do MLH Hackathons Create Opportunity?</h1>



<p>Major League Hacking hackathons are transformative thanks to the environment created by informal community opportunity. Unlike the structured confines of a classroom, hackathons for next gen developers encourage experimentation, bold creativity, and real-world problem-solving. Imagine hundreds of invention weekends happening all over the world. That&#8217;s MLH! <a href="https://youtu.be/qj4DQfYx2Hg">We power over 300 of these events every year, connecting with more than 500,000 developers who show up ready to dream big and build something amazing.</a> Forget the usual classroom rules; MLH hackathons are all about jumping in, trying new things, and solving real world problems. Students work side by side with peer mentors, attend workshops led by industry professionals, and build projects that mirror the responsibilities of actual engineering roles. This experience is the perfect launchpad for apprenticeships because it proves you have the initiative, the flexibility, and the teamwork skills that are just as important as technical knowledge.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">How Do Hackathons Create Wider Opportunities for Growth?</h1>



<p>Companies know the power of hands-on learning, and companies look for hackathon experience. For many employers, seeing &#8220;MLH involvement&#8221; on a resume isn&#8217;t just a bonus. It&#8217;s solid proof that a student is ready to contribute and grow right away. According to our latest survey, more than 80% of students want Major League Hacking to help connect them to potential employers. That tells you just how much this community sees MLH as the place to find their next big chance. <br />And it&#8217;s working! According to our surveys, hackathon participants are getting jobs because of the connections they make at hackathons. It could be a recruiter they connected with, a teammate who turned into a great referral, or a cool project that caught a hiring manager’s eye. The journeys of these students reveal the lasting impact that MLH can have on a young developer&#8217;s career. Hackathons are more than a series of events–they’re a bridge to the future.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get into tech, MLH is the perfect spot to take that first big leap. It&#8217;s a place where students figure out what they&#8217;re good at, gain confidence by actually building things, and meet awesome people who push them to be better. <a href="https://www.mlh.com/seasons/2026/events">Find your next hackathon opportunity here.</a></p>
<p>For many, it&#8217;s the weekend that changes everything.</p>

<p>So you’re finally doing it. You’re getting yourself out of the house on a weekend and going to your very first Major League Hacking hackathon. Congratulations!</p>
<p>A hackathon is an event that typically lasts for an afternoon or for as long as an entire week, where developers and laypeople work together to collaboratively build creative solutions to problems they have observed, generally in the form of software or hardware projects.</p>
<p>Hackathons have been happening for years. Did you know that <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier,</a> the workflow-automation platform that allows users to connect apps and automate tasks, was thought up during a hackathon in Missouri in 2011? Or that the global winter gift exchange, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedditGifts">RedditGifts</a>, came to life during Reddit’s annual hackathon in 2009?</p>
<p>The creativity and innovation present at hackathons are unmatched, and now you get to be part of the excitement! If you haven’t been to one, then you’re in luck! Here’s a general overview of what to expect at a hackathon.</p>
<h2>Hackathon Schedule</h2>
<p>The hackathon you have signed up for could take place at a myriad of places, but most commonly, you will find yourself on a school campus, in a corporate meeting space, or at a convention center, depending on the size and scope of the event.</p>
<p>When you arrive at a Major League Hacking-run hackathon, you can expect a few common experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you arrive on-site, you can expect to register for the event. Look for the line of equally excited people near the entrance.</li>
<li>The organizers of your hackathon – often partners of MLH or representatives from our team – will welcome you to the weekend and give you the lay of the land.</li>
<li>Your hackathon may have advice on Steps for a Successful Hackathon! Listen carefully and get ready to have fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>MLH events are organized around the most important part of the day: Your Creations! So, once you leave the entry hall and theater-style presentations, you will spend the rest of your time working on teams to innovate and learn from each other. This is, in fact, where the majority of the hackathon happens.</p>
<p>After 24-36 hours of building your project with your group (more on that in a second), you will come back together to present your project to a panel of judges. The judges will review your code, test your product, and evaluate its success on a number of variables.</p>
<p>After judging, most hackathons conclude with a keynote from the judges and the presentation of winners and prizes. After that, you are free to go home. But know it doesn’t have to end there. Many hackathon organizations, including MLH, have virtual communities you can continue participating in via Discord and other social and community platforms. Be sure to sign up before you sign off.</p>
<h2>Your Hackathon Group</h2>
<p>No hackathon, Major League Hacking-run or otherwise, makes you go it alone! Hackathons are about group creativity, learning from each other, and collaboration. As a result, you will be building and learning with other people! It can be intimidating to meet new folks, but remember, everyone at the hackathon, regardless of their experience level, is in the same boat as you.</p>
<p>Most hackathons limit groups to a maximum of 4 people. You can expect to have a mix of experience, both in terms of developer experience and in speciality. What does this mean? You might be the most experienced person on your team or the person with the fewest years of experience. And you always have something to contribute and something to learn from other people.</p>
<p>Look forward to a groupthink mentality of “We’ll figure it out.” Consider using the hackathon as an opportunity to try new things and processes. You never know what you might absolutely love.</p>
<p>Once you have your team and you’ve discussed what it is you want to build (sometimes this is the most exciting and time-consuming part of the day!), you can get started.</p>
<p>Here’s where the hackathon &lt;&gt; marathon analogy comes to life. You have 24 hours now to build. You can expect to work closely with your peers to create the most complete and workable version of your idea before Day 2 truly begins.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<h2>How Hackathons Are Judged</h2>
<p>On Day 2 of your first hackathon, you get a chance to share your collaboration with a team of expert judges. After uploading all the details of your project to DevPost (so that judges can review all the project details and tech), you will have a short interview with the judges. These are often as short as 5 minutes. They might look at your code, or talk to your team about what problem your project solves for, who it’s for, and who will use it. Then, you get a chance to demo the result of 24 hours of hard work and see something come to life.</p>
<p>This piece of the puzzle can take time – at least half a day – before any awards are given.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony, the hosts of your hackathon will recognize the most successful builds, teams, and collaborators. Prizes are awarded and can look like loot bags, gift cards, equipment, and cash. Every hackathon is different so don’t be discouraged or disappointed if the awards given don’t match your immediate expectation or if you don’t place as highly as you will in the future. We’re all here to learn and come away from the hackathon with new experience, new skills, and new friends.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now that you’ve gotten to the “I want to start my own Hackathon” moment, now comes the fun part: <a href="https://guide.mlh.io/?_gl=1*znhtap*_ga*MTc4NDMzNTQ0Ny4xNzU5MTY2MDk2*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*czE3NjYwODQ0MTQkbzE3JGcwJHQxNzY2MDg0NDE0JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">putting it all together.</a> Here are a few steps to consider as you prepare to see your dream of creating your hackathon come to life.  </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Plan your date and location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you do anything, you’ll need to pick a date and location that work for your target audience. Choose a venue with good infrastructure (enough space to accommodate participants, plenty of power outlets, good lighting, breakout or quiet areas, etc.). If you decide to have a Hackathon that’s virtual or hybrid, make sure you’ve chosen a platform and format so your audience knows what to expect. <br /><br /></span>Once your date and location are locked in, you should start spreading the word about your hackathon to potential participants. Share the date on your social media channels, create social media accounts for the name of your hackathon, and make sure your event is registered on event pages for local schools and developer organizations like Major League Hacking. The sooner you start building out promotion, the sooner your hackathon will gain momentum.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Preparation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve secured your date and venue, it’s time to move into preparation mode. This may include logistics, registration, promotion, and ensuring the foundational infrastructure is stable. Make sure things like Wi-Fi/back-end tech are ready to go (because any lags or outages can kill momentum). <br /></span><br />As I said in step one, set up registration and RSVP tracking so you know how many participants to expect, what skills they’re offering, and what they’ll need to bring to the hackathon itself. <br />An additional tip: to avoid any mishaps during the event, it’s best to create a run-of-show and have a contingency plan (for tech failures, schedule delays, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Event execution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the day (or weekend) of your hackathon arrives, execution is everything. Your final preparations should include setting up the space, testing the Wi-Fi / AV, briefing your team on check-in, and judging. Having a timeline from 1 week before, 1 day before, and game-day checklists will be vital. You’ve rehearsed this so many times; this list will serve as that guide.  <br /><br /></span>Kick-off: Start off by welcoming participants. They’re heading into an unfamiliar place for 24 or 48 hours, so warming them up will smooth over any worries they might have. Then, you should explain the goals and rules, introduce mentors/judges, and start forming teams. During the hackathon, ensure mentors are available, teams are aware of key milestones, and that you monitor progress and morale (food breaks, short updates, and encouragement are all important to everyone). <br /><br />Then, when time is up, it’s on to demos, judging, and announcing the winner. Judges should have a clear criterion for the categories they’re judging (innovation, business value, technical implementation, or presentation), and the closing ceremony is an opportunity to celebrate results.<br /><br />Throughout the hackathon, make sure you have some recording of the entire event, including the pitch demos. Consider live-share on social media like Instagram and X if relevant (or allowed to). If so, ensure that participants sign a waiver when they RSVP to the hackathon, and capture the energy of the event. </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Post-event</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the hackathon is officially done, the work isn’t over. The post-event phase is important for sustaining momentum. Right off the bat, send thank-you notes to all the participants, mentors, sponsors, volunteers, and judges for the time they invested in the event. Include a link to a survey for feedback: what worked, what didn’t, and what they’d like next time. This builds rapport and goodwill for future events. While doing this, review the content from the event (blog post, recap email, photos/videos of the projects and winners) and start posting on your hackathon’s social media channels. This will keep the event freshly top-of-mind for not only those who took part in the event, but those who wished they could have been there. <br /><br /></span>If some project ideas have potential beyond the hackathon, consider next steps (e.g., further development, incubation, or showcasing). That turns a hackathon from just a weekend into a pipeline for innovation.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Reflect and iterate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This final step is applicable for any hackathon: reflect on what you’ve learned, review your metrics (number of participants, projects completed, feedback ratings, media/social reach), and identify areas for improvement for next time. Documenting what worked and didn’t is a positive reflection that will help you scale up or refine your next hackathon.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Major League Hacking (MLH) is excited to announce a new initiative to expand access to blockchain education and hands-on learning for next-gen developers worldwide, with a focus on Solana, the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’re creating new ways for students and next-gen developers to learn, build, and explore the future of decentralized technology. As of December 2025, Solana will debut at MLH hackathons across the world, offering participants hands-on opportunities to experiment with blockchain development. Through workshops, technical challenges, and mentorship, developers will be able to gain practical experience building on Solana in a supportive environment designed for learning-by-doing.</p>
<h2>Learning by Doing, Supported by Solana Technology</h2>
<p>At MLH, our mission has always been to help developers learn by doing. This initiative builds directly on that philosophy by giving students access to the tools, resources, and guidance they need to turn ideas into real, deployable projects.</p>
<p>Solana’s debut at MLH hackathons represents more than a new track. It’s an invitation for student developers to join an active, global ecosystem. By bringing Solana technology directly into hackathon environments, we’re helping hackers take their first steps into blockchain development with the tools and mentorship to succeed.</p>
<h2>Building Beyond the Hackathon: The Solana Micro-Grant Program</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting parts of this initiative is the launch of the Solana Micro-Grant Program, coming later this year.</p>
<p>Through this initiative, MLH and Solana will award up to 75 developer micro-grants through December 2026, helping promising projects continue long after the hackathon weekend ends. These grants will support a wide range of projects, from developer tooling and educational templates to early-stage startups and public-good infrastructure that strengthen the Solana ecosystem.</p>
<p>In addition to funding, grant recipients will receive mentorship and community exposure, helping them grow their projects and connect with other builders in the Solana network. It’s another way MLH helps ensure that great ideas don’t just start at hackathons; they keep growing.</p>
<h2>Expanding Hands-On Blockchain Education</h2>
<p>The initiative will also extend to our Fellowship Program, where students will have opportunities to contribute directly to Solana-related open-source projects in place of a traditional internship. This means students won’t just learn how blockchain works. They’ll build real-world software that powers it.</p>
<p>Additional educational support, including workshops, developer challenges, and learning content, will help participants understand key concepts in Solana program development, payments, and AI.</p>
<h2>A Global Opportunity for Builders</h2>
<p>While the initial rollout focuses on North America, the initiative will soon expand globally through initiatives like 100 Days of Solana, an open developer learning challenge that invites hackers from around the world to explore blockchain development together.</p>
<p>This aligns with MLH’s commitment to accessibility and inclusion in tech. Our community already spans over one million student developers across 98 countries, and with Solana’s involvement, even more hackers will have access to cutting-edge tools, mentorship, and funding opportunities.</p>
<h2>What This Means for the MLH Community</h2>
<p>This initiative represents a natural evolution of MLH’s mission: to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world experience. By integrating Solana’s technology and developer ecosystem into MLH programs, we’re helping next-gen developers gain future-ready skills and the confidence to apply them in meaningful ways.</p>
<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>We are thrilled to announce a new partnership between Major League Hacking (MLH) and Google Cloud. Over 3 years, we will be integrating Google Cloud’s latest Gemini models across our network of more than 4,000 community chapters with the goal of fostering a new generation of engineers who see AI as an integral part of their creative toolbox. We know competition is intensifying between AI platforms and that developer mindshare matters more than ever. Our own data shows Google Cloud’s Gemini models are experiencing the fastest growth in actual usage among next-gen developers, suggesting hands-on experience drives adoption more effectively than brand awareness alone.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Major League Hacking &amp; Google Cloud’s Gemini Will Work Together</span></h2>
<p>We’re excited to start integrating Google’s Gemini models into MLH’s network of engineers, <span style="font-weight: 400;">where 1 in 3 Computer Science grads each year are members of the MLH Community</span>. It’s a central tenet of MLH that we understand real learning rarely takes place in a classroom–it takes place on the ground, in real situations where you learn to code and build, and create new things with the latest tools. Having these models at your fingertips will make MLH community members more equipped to build for the future.</p>
<p>While there is a three-phase plan in place to reach as many of our members as we can, the adoption of these AI models will take time to fully deploy. In Phase One, we will feature the models at 250+ MLH hackathons through dedicated prizes, workshops, and developer resources. Phase Two will amplify this initial utilization of the models with conferences and custom coding challenges so that more engineers are able to work directly with the models in real time. In Phase Three, Google’s Gemini models will be embedded into daily programming activities through local chapter meetups and hack nights.</p>
<p>It is our hope that we will be able to move through the phases of this plan in a way that gets Google’s Gemini models into the hands of engineers swiftly so that our communities can grow even as the technology becomes more and more advanced.</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Model Exposure Builds Engineers of the Future</span></h1>
<p>MLH is dedicated to creating educational opportunities for software creators and engineers at all levels of the learning experience. We know AI is already transforming software development, and early exposure to AI platforms during university years increasingly determines which tools developers will adopt throughout their careers.</p>
<p>We also know that diversity in engineering sectors matters. Exposing MLH&#8217;s diverse tech education community to these tools early is vital to ensuring the pipeline to professional software development remains as diverse as software users are. With nearly 50% of the MLH community identifying as non-male and two-thirds as people of color – significantly more diverse than traditional Computer Science programs – we are uniquely positioned to have an outsized effect on driving diversity in the industry. And our members span 93 countries, giving this partnership and Google’s Gemini models global reach among emerging developers.</p>
<p>MLH communities are passionate and driven to excellence. We can’t wait to see what our local chapters use Google Gemini models to build in the coming months and years. If you’re looking for a local instance of Major League Hacking, <a href="https://mlh.io/seasons/2026/events">explore our upcoming hackathons and join us</a>!</p>

<h1><b>What is a hackathon?</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First time hearing about hackathons? You’re in good company. Every year, thousands of students discover the magic of these weekend-long “invention marathons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it as a creative sprint where you team up to bring a wild idea to life—building anything from a game-changing app to a quirky robot. Whether you’re a coding veteran or just starting, hackathons are your launchpad to learn new skills, meet future collaborators, find career opportunities, and have an unforgettable weekend.</span></p>
<h1><b>The 2025 Season Recap</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2025 Hackathon Season was an incredible journey. Last year alone, we empowered more than 150,000 hackers across 184 hackathons and other programs. Across all those programs, hackers created over 12,500 projects!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look back at some of our favorite moments:</span></p>
<h2><b>Hackers leveled up with AI!</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that Artificial Intelligence is everywhere nowadays, and hackathons are no exception! Our community is embracing the ever-changing landscape of AI and using these tools to supercharge their projects. Never before have we seen so many hackers go from their very first hello world to a fully functional project so quickly. Our community is learning how to utilize these tools to ship better projects faster by leveraging them as debuggers, copy editors, idea generators, and more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>

<h2><b>Mini Events and Meetups Blossomed </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many hackers, the events that occur during the hackathon are just as important (or more important!) than the hackathon itself. We launched TechTogether meetups, providing hackers with an opportunity to connect and discuss the topics that matter to them. Organizers leaned into themes and got creative, like HackGT, which hosted an entire carnival at their event last fall. uOttaHack took things outdoors and ventured to a local (and very frozen) canal to ice skate. </span></p>

<h1>Rapid AI: Powered Applications With the Django-MongoDB Backend and Voyage API</h1>
<h3><em>This article is written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksendric/">Marko Aleksendric</a> (Data Analyst)</em></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got an appetite for learning about the latest in AI and how you can use it to transform the way you work, then this article is for you. Discover how the powerful combination of Django, MongoDB&#8217;s new AI smarts, and Voyage AI can turn your leftover ingredients into delicious dinner ideas – no grocery run needed!</p>
<p>MongoDB is enhancing its platform with AI-powered search and retrieval features, like embeddings and reranking, to make data processing smarter and more efficient. These tools are key in systems like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which improve AI outputs by fetching the most relevant data to ground those responses. By integrating these capabilities directly into the database layer, MongoDB is simplifying application stacks, reducing the need for complex AI pipelines, and improving data accuracy. In this project, we’ll build a RAG-like system to demonstrate how these features work in practice!</p>
<h1>A Brief History</h1>
<p>Django is one of the most mature and actively maintained web frameworks in the Python ecosystem, renowned for its &#8220;batteries included&#8221; philosophy. It enables rapid development of secure, maintainable web applications by offering built-in support for URL routing, middleware, template rendering, form handling, authentication, and database abstraction via a powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). Django projects follow the Model–View–Template (MVT) architecture, where models define the data schema, views handle the application logic, and templates control the presentation layer.</p>
<p>Though initially designed to render HTML on the server side, Django has evolved to support modern web development patterns. Tools like Django REST Framework and Django-Ninja allow developers to expose APIs in JSON format, enabling Django to serve as a backend for single-page applications and mobile apps. In addition, its extensible admin interface—automatically generated from your models—provides powerful CRUD capabilities out of the box. Combined with robust security defaults, scalability features, a vast third-party package ecosystem, and thorough documentation, Django remains a top choice for Python developers building anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade applications.</p>

<h1>A Needed Integration</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://mlh.link/django-mongodb-backend-docs-may2025">Django MongoDB Backend</a> is a new official integration from MongoDB that lets Django developers use MongoDB as the database behind their projects. This backend offers deep support for core Django features like models, migrations, and the admin panel—while still giving access to MongoDB’s advanced capabilities like aggregations and vector search. It’s easy to set up using Django’s standard settings system, and while it&#8217;s still in public preview and not yet recommended for production, it opens up exciting possibilities for building modern, AI-powered web apps with Django and MongoDB together!</p>
<h1>The project: A Smart Recipe Application</h1>
<p>We’ll use Django and MongoDB to cook up a smart recipe app that finds dishes you can make with what’s already in your fridge. In this project, you&#8217;ll work with several cutting-edge technologies to build an AI-powered recipe app. <strong>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of what you&#8217;ll be using and learning:</strong></p>

<h1>A New Playing Field</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m Simerus, a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I love working on challenging problems at scale and creating solutions that make a real difference in people’s lives. My journey toward this passion, however, was anything but conventional. Growing up, I always wanted to be a soccer player. I played at the provincial level and had my sights set on becoming a pro, receiving university varsity offers in the process.</p>
<p>I played forward, and I loved scoring goals. It made me feel like I was having a tangible impact on my team’s success. However, I came to realize that this feeling of success didn’t truly fulfill me because it would only last for a game. That’s when I started searching for other things that interested me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3169" src="http://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot-300x300.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot-125x125.jpeg 125w, https://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://news.mlh.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Simerus-Headshot.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic was what steered me toward Software Engineering as a profession. I was in high school when it hit, and I witnessed firsthand how the sudden isolation impacted my friends, family, and community. Since I had already been exploring Computer Science courses on the side, I began wondering if I could use those skills to make a real difference.</p>
<p>Collaborating with a team, we developed an AI Therapy application that gained over 1,000 users. The main goal was to provide people with a platform to express themselves and improve their verbal positivity using gamification. Along the way, we formed partnerships with local high schools, collaborated on research with our local school board’s psychology department, and won several pitch competitions – I was even featured on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhernholm/2023/01/31/teen-entrepreneurshow-chatgpt-is-changing-their-education-and-how-they-do-business/">Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>That experience gave me the fulfillment I&#8217;d been seeking. I thrived in a fast-paced environment where a bunch of things were happening at once, enjoying every moment of building something that genuinely impacted people and added real value. This realization solidified my decision to pursue a tech career, dedicated to making a positive impact.</p>
<h1>A Doorway into Tech — The MLH Fellowship</h1>
<p>As I continued my journey, I learned about the MLH Fellowship after building a winning project at CruzHacks in 2022. I was in high school at the time and wasn’t old enough to pursue it yet, but in my first year of university I decided to apply.</p>
<p>I had seen a post about the Production Engineering Fellowship, a field that I wanted to learn more about because it’s something every company incorporates to scale their products but doesn’t really get covered in school. The Fellowship was my pathway to learning more about this field and starting my career in this space.</p>
<p>The content of the Production Engineering Fellowship was exciting. Each week, I learned about a new topic in Production Engineering, building a solid foundation alongside my Software Engineering skills. I learned about fundamental topics like cloud computing, system design, networking, operating systems, DevOps, troubleshooting, and more.</p>
<p>I put these principles into practice in my research and projects, too. For example, during the Fellowship, I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/simerusm/meta-meet">Google Meet Clone</a> with another fellow. I developed and deployed the app and facilitated many of the Fellowship meetings on it. It was pretty cool to see everything I’ve learned put into practice and being used by people.</p>
<p>After finishing the Fellowship, I landed internships at PlayStation, Meta, Microsoft and more. This winter, I’ve been interning at PlayStation. I’m carrying out a POC to revamp their infrastructure, with the goal of reducing costs, operational overhead, and maintenance. It’s been fascinating work so far, seeing how companies do things at scale.</p>
<h1>How can you start your own journey?</h1>
<p>For other Fellows or aspiring developers wondering how I got here, I believe a lot of it comes down to consistent effort. Last summer, I dedicated myself to learning new concepts and putting them into practice every day. You’d be amazed how much progress you can make with focused learning and practice over a month than if you just did stuff here and there over 4 months.</p>
<p>Production Engineering is a vast field, and you&#8217;ll never know it all, which is exactly what makes it so exciting. There are always ways to do things better, make things faster, and impact more people. I think that the beauty of infrastructure is that it connects every corner of tech. Every company relies on a well-designed system to scale effectively, thus making it a necessity.</p>
<p>I enjoy this field, and I can see myself working on these sorts of challenging problems for years. Recently, I built a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZcao5d6pE44izXeYkgmyKMBhOFt1TZJ/view?usp=sharing">distributed training platform</a> that allows people to train machine learning models using MacBook clusters. I’ve also been building a Vercel clone for local development that allows people to deploy their microservices seamlessly by connecting regular (e.g., frontend to backend) and miscellaneous (e.g., backend to database/cache) service-to-service connections without the need for configuration.</p>
<p>I think that if you want to start your journey into Production Engineering and anything backend-infrastructure related, I’d recommend you start by learning the basics of this field. Focus on topics like networking, operating systems, and system design. Whether it’s through the MLH Fellowship or on your own, with the AI tools available and proper discipline, anyone can do the things I’ve done.</p>

<h1>From Academia to Open Source: A Journey of Code, Collaboration, and Impact</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s one thing that defines the journey of a technologist, it is insatiable curiosity. Like most students, my academic path was paved with structured curricula, assignments, and exams. But something always felt missing — the thrill of tackling real-world challenges, the opportunity to collaborate beyond the walls of my university, and the ability to create something truly impactful. </span></p>
<p><b>That is until open source entered my life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not just as a side interest but as a gateway to an extraordinary world of learning, collaboration, and innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My introduction to open source was accidental yet serendipitous. During my undergraduate years, I stumbled upon </span><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"><b>Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where I worked with </span><a href="https://github.com/fossology"><b>FOSSology</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open-source license compliance tool maintained by Siemens Research Group. This experience unlocked a new perspective for me. I was no longer bound to theoretical exercises. Instead, I was navigating large, complex codebases and engaging with developers across continents. This was learning unlike anything a textbook could offer. </span><b>The kind that comes from building, breaking, and fixing real software.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This realization ignited a passion in me. I returned for </span>GSoC 2020<span style="font-weight: 400;">, deepening my involvement in mentorship (guiding students each year as part of GSoC for </span><a href="https://github.com/fossology"><b>FOSSology</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and I became a steward for open-source contributions. I co-founded </span><b>HypnOS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a technical community during my undergraduate years. I actively developed projects, participated in numerous hackathons, and worked on building real-world solutions addressing tangible problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each contribution reinforced a powerful lesson: </span><b>knowledge grows exponentially when shared, and nothing embodies this spirit like open source.</b></p>
<h1>My Next Step into Open Source: The MLH Fellowship</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/"><b>MLH Fellowship</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a natural continuation of my open-source journey. Unlike a typical internship where projects are often isolated or internal, this experience brought me face-to-face with cutting-edge technologies at Meta, specifically </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/audioseal"><b>AudioSeal</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open-source audio watermarking system. </span><b>Here, I wasn’t just writing code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I was collaborating with some of the brightest research minds at Meta, experimenting with audio fingerprinting, adversarial attacks, and robust detection mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audiocraft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/dora"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and PyTorch, I created custom training grids, ran extensive benchmarking, and helped refine the model’s robustness. </span><b>But more than the technical depth, what stood out was the spirit of collaboration.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As I worked alongside engineers from Meta, I saw firsthand how distributed teams build powerful, scalable solutions.</span></p>
<p><b>The beauty of open source is that it</b> <b>teaches you what academia often misses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You learn how to read complex code, debug in ways no classroom will prepare you for, and engage with a global community that is constantly innovating. </span><b>You’re not just a student or an intern. You’re an active participant in building the future.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond my technical contributions, the Fellowship nurtured my collaborative and leadership instincts. I networked with fellows working on different projects, gaining insight into how diverse yet community-driven the open-source world truly is. I reviewed PRs, guided discussions, and experienced the sheer joy of helping and being helped by others who were paving their open-source journeys. </span><b>It wasn’t just about writing software. It was about building a culture of knowledge-sharing and empowerment.</b></p>
<h1>The Launchpad of Open Source</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I look ahead, I see my path in responsible AI and NLP, particularly in ensuring ethical and accurate AI systems. My current research on &#8220;Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in LLMs for Healthcare&#8221; is a testament to this vision, addressing how AI-generated misinformation can be curbed for critical applications. </span><b>My time in the MLH Fellowship accelerated my immersion into the fast-paced AI world</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the advice from my mentors at Meta has been instrumental in shaping my journey toward impactful research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond research and academia, </span><b>I see</b> <b>open source as a lifelong commitment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I plan to pursue a PhD, where I hope to explore the intersection of NLP, AI ethics, and social impact applications with the same spirit of open collaboration that first drew me into this space.</span></p>
<p><b>To those considering dipping their toes into open source, my advice is simple: jump in. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no perfect time, no perfect project, just an ocean of opportunities waiting for you to explore. Whether it’s fixing a small bug, contributing to documentation, or building your first feature, every step is a step toward mastery. The community welcomes you, mentors guide you, and before you know it, you become part of something bigger than yourself.</span></p>
<p><b>Open source changed my life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not just as a coder but as a </span><b>thinker, a leader, and a lifelong learner</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I hope it changes yours too.</span></p>
