# Introduction

#### Welcome to the MLH Hackathon Organizer Guide! This is a community initiative by [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io) that contains a lot of the lessons that we and the hackathon community around the world have learned from organizing hackathons — all in a single student hackathon playbook.

Take a look and learn some of the practices used by hackathon organizers all around the world. This guide should contain most, if not all, of the practices you need to throw a great hackathon.

**Disclaimer:** The hackathon organizer guide is never finished. It's an ongoing project that we're always trying to update as we and the global hackathon organizer community learn. Try everything, and feel free to contribute your learnings back to the guide with a pull request over on [our GitHub repository for this guide](https://github.com/mlh/hackathon-organizer-guide).

# After The Event

Congratulations — you pulled off a successful hackathon! To close out your event, follow this post-event checklist to ensure you finish on a high note:

* [ ] **Collect evidence of your success** — aggregate press mentions, tweets, photos, videos, etc. These will be invaluable for promoting your next hackathon.
* [ ] **Send a thank you note** to your sponsors with key numbers, event highlights, and your best photos.
  * Always be closing: offer sponsors a special deal if they agree to sponsor your next hackathon. (See [sponsorship webinar ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI9NVe2wA5w)for more details.)
* [ ] **Email attendees and sponsors a post-event survey**. The information you receive will help you make your next hackathon even better.
* [ ] **Settle the books** and send final payments.
* [ ] **Schedule a retrospective** with MLH.
* [ ] **Attend** [**MLH Hackcon**](https://hackcon.mlh.io/) to collaborate with other hackathon organizers, share your story, and connect with our great community.

# Build Your Leadership Team

Every first-rate hackathon has an exceptional leadership team behind it. When selecting yours, **think like a startup CEO: choose enthusiastic and smart people with complementary skills**. Think of your hackathon as your product and your team as the people putting it together. Here’s what a typical hackathon leadership team looks like:

* **Hackathon Lead Organizer:** The person in charge of all the happenings in and around the hackathon. They look after the entire team making decisions on what will be the next best steps in a particular situation.&#x20;
* **Logistics Team:** This team is responsible for all logistics of the hackathon like booking the venue, developing and making the schedule, ordering swag, prizes, food and other essentials for the event etc.
* **Finance Team:** This team is responsible for securing sponsorships, making sure the vendors get paid according to the agreed timelines and managing the cash flow and budget.
* **Marketing Team:** This team is in charge of promoting the event, deciding the marketing strategy, developing the website, handling social media etc.
* **Operations Team:** This team is responsible for the hacker experience at the hackathon. Every aspect of what the hackathon looks and feels like, this team is entirely responsible for that. Keep in mind, hacker experience is usually the thing that can make or break your hackathon. We might like to call this the think tank of your hackathon team.

## Leading your team

It’s vital to get your team onto the same page for your hackathon so you’re all working as a collective team rather than individual teams with different goals. To get there focusing on these specific areas would be highly beneficial:

* **Project management:** Ensure that all tasks are tracked for the entire team to see, we encourage you to&#x20;
  * Avoid confusion and increase efficiency by making **one person responsible** for each team, managing the different day to day task/s within it.&#x20;
  * Assign each team to lead different tasks on your **project management tool** (Trello, Notion, Asana etc.) with deadlines.&#x20;
  * Follow up with each of the individual heads to **get status updates** on their tasks to keep them accountable. &#x20;
* **Team management**: As you all integrate new team members, there’s a bunch for them to learn about from team dynamics to how to do their role. To start off, try out the [mini-events](../organizer-resources/host-exciting-mini-events/) your team is considering having at the event, as team building activities to get the team more comfortable with each other.
*   **Staying Organized:** Working towards organizing any event becomes difficult if there's any communication gap in your team. There are tons of ways to keep your hackathon planning team organized and on track. If your team is working remotely, it's even more important to have a system in place. The actual tools you use don't matter as much as picking them and sticking to it. As hackathon organizers, it can be easy to over-engineer your planning process. Keep in mind that sometimes the simplest solutions are the easiest for the whole team to adopt and use.

    Some tools we've seen work well for organizing teams are:

    * **Chat:** Slack, Discord
    * **Documents:** Google Drive (G-Suite, if possible), Notion, Airtable&#x20;
    * **Task Management:** Asana, Notion, Trello

# Finding the Date & Purpose

## Finding the purpose

As you begin to plan your hackathon, it's important to think about the purpose of your event. Brainstorm with your organizing team the _**why**_ behind your event. This will help as you make decisions while planning your hackathon.

Finding a purpose is usually very personal to the people who are looking to organize a hackathon. It can be to empower your local community, targeting a specific section of the community, empowering a certain social group, making people aware about a different technology or the computer science in general or even just building out the culture of hackathons in your school or organization. When you have the clarity behind what you actually need to do, you will be easily making decisions on how you need to implement it.

You also need to determine the length of your event. Will people need time to travel to the event? Does your school have classes on Friday? We recommend events start on Friday evening, or Saturday morning, and that the events end on Sunday afternoon. Ending the event on Sunday and announcing winners gives a sense of closure for attendees, and recognizes the work they did over the weekend.&#x20;

To be a MLH Member Event, your event must be on a weekend (Earliest start Friday, latest end Sunday)

## Finding the Date

After you've solidified the purpose of your event, it's time to pick out a date! Things to consider as you choose your date are:

* **Major events at your university/ organization:** It is important to reduce any chances of a clash or having major events simultaneously around your local community. This will actually determine the interest people might have to attend your event.
* **Major holidays and festivals:** It depends a lot culturally but having events in and around holidays is a great way to attract more crowd. _\*\*_
* **University breaks:** Having events during long breaks might result in reduced participation. This _\*\*_&#x69;s because a lot of students tend to take up internships/ summer programs or something similar during these breaks. Having a weekend hackathon during a short break might result in increase participation as well!
* **Dates of other hackathons that serve your community:** Hackers tend to be more inclined towards having the best experience possible. Having them to decide between two or more hackathons happening around might result in reduced participation and even affecting majorly on the registration to turn up ratio for the event.&#x20;
* **Dates of major exams at your university:** Hackers are students too! Scheduling your hackathon after the exams is one of the best things to attract more hackers and have most of their attention. Please keep in mind to have time as organizers to prepare for exams as that will severely affect your ability to give your best to the hackathon experience.
* **Date of Hackcon:** MLH hosts our organizer conference Hackcon around the last weekend of August each year. If your event is on the same weekend as Hackcon we will not be able to partner with you. We are still happy to give advice leading up to the event, but our entire staff will be at the conference.&#x20;

# Locking Down a Venue

Few of your planning decisions will truly make or break your hackathon, but your choice of venue is one of them. It often takes more time than expected to secure the right location, so the earlier you begin scouting, the better! Having a confirmed venue will also prove to potential sponsors and attendees that you’re serious about hosting a great event.

Keep in mind your venue should be **free.** In most cases, you _should_ be able to find a university or company sponsored space.

### Research Venues on Your Campus

On-campus venues are best because they’re accessible to your hackers and are usually free. Research past events at your school to get a sense of each venue's capabilities. Do they meet your hackathon’s requirements? Make a list of your favorites after considering pros and cons.

Note: Each venue usually has one university representative who oversees bookings. One shortcut to finding them is contacting students who previously held events at that space and asking how they recommend you proceed.

### Enlist a Campus Advocate to Help You Navigate the Bureaucracy

A university advocate, such as a professor or dean, can significantly simplify your venue search by helping you navigate your school’s unique booking process.

In most cases, this person will be your organization’s advisor. You should have a quick elevator pitch that everyone on your organizing committee can give to campus representatives you'll be working with ("No, we will not be breaking into your bank account. A hackathon is…").

We have created [guides for three administrative groups](https://news.mlh.io/hackathon-guides-for-parents-and-administrators-09-10-2015) ([university representatives](https://mlh.io/college-administrator-hackathon-guide?_gl=1*1yk1xvp*_ga*MTA4NTA2NjQ4NS4xNzMzNDk1NjQx*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*MTc0MTcyMzg2NC4xMTkuMS4xNzQxNzI0ODA2LjAuMC4w), [high school faculty](https://mlh.io/high-school-administrator-hackathon-guide?_gl=1*880qeb*_ga*MTA4NTA2NjQ4NS4xNzMzNDk1NjQx*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*MTc0MTcyMzg2NC4xMTkuMS4xNzQxNzI0ODIwLjAuMC4w), and [parents](https://mlh.io/parent-hackathon-guide?_gl=1*8xjjyd*_ga*MTA4NTA2NjQ4NS4xNzMzNDk1NjQx*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*MTc0MTcyMzg2NC4xMTkuMS4xNzQxNzI0ODUwLjAuMC4w)). These guides explain what a hackathon is, why it is beneficial for a school, and why it is beneficial for students. It also contains various resources that will be useful for university advocates to convince other faculty members.

In a short email to potential advocates, you can include:

* A brief definition of a hackathon. We like to explain it as weekend long invention competition.
* The most relevant guide from the list above.
* Videos and/or photos from past events.
* At least 3 ways students will _directly_ benefit from an on-campus hackathon.

Frame your hackathon as a recruiting event with a twist. Your school most likely already hosts a recurring career fair -- you can pitch your event relative to this terminology to immediately align it with your school’s goals.

## What If You Can't Find an On-Campus Location?

On rare occasions, students may not be able to find a free on-campus venue. In this case, we recommend the following.

* Research venues in your area that have held events of a similar size: other hackathons, conferences, etc. If you know someone who organized one of these events, ask for an introduction to their director.
* Approach several companies that stand to gain something by sharing their space with you, such as a tech company that recruits programmers and designers. Your short email introduction should include the same information you sent to potential on-campus advocates:
  * A brief definition of a hackathon.
    * Libraries are expanding to more than just physical books. Find one with a Makerspace who might be interested in getting more people to try it out! These are a great fit for any Hardware focused hackathons.&#x20;
  * Videos and/or photos of past events.
  * At least 3 ways students will _directly_ benefit from using this location.&#x20;

Whenever possible, **avoid paying to rent a venue**. With additional and hidden charges, it could easily double the cost of your hackathon. In addition to the rental fee, you will be responsible for providing all of the infrastructure required to run a large event, including Internet wiring, table and chair rental, and your own security team.

If you really can’t find a free venue, look into renting a coworking space with most of this infrastructure in place.

### Double Check What Your Venue Provides

Before you book an event space, make sure it has everything you need help you host a successful hackathon. The list below covers some important considerations. [Refer to our venue checklist for the complete list!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NRs6pM0mEetgIFJVvPr5pN5O3diOuTKuhbGZkWMb87c/edit?tab=t.0)

* **Overnight** — Is the venue aware that students will be staying overnight? Can hackers who need to sleep during the hackathon find a dedicated and safe place to do so?&#x20;
* **Enough capacity** — The average MLH hackathon is around 300 student hackers. Can the venue accommodate the number of attendees you plan to host?
* **The right physical space** — Your venue must have space for hackers to work and listen to speakers, as well as designated areas for hardware, food, sponsors, and MLH.
* **WiFi** — Can the WiFi support a large number of people in a condensed space? It should be able to handle 4 devices per hacker.&#x20;
* **Power** — Is there enough amperage for hundreds of computers, phones, and hardware devices? Assume you'll need at least 2.5 outlets per hacker.
* **A/V equipment and staff**— What A/V equipment is available? Does the venue offer staff to help you set it up?
* **Tables and chairs** — How many seats and tables do you need? Does the venue provide them, or do you need to rent from a separate vendor? Coordinate with your vendor to create a floor plan.
* **Food**— Does the venue offer catering? If it does, are you required to use it? How much will this cost?
* **Accessibility** — Can hackers in need of physical accommodation conveniently access the building?
* **Security** — Will there be a secure space where sponsors, organizers, and attendees can keep expensive equipment? Does the venue offer their own security, or do you need to find and pay for them?

If your venue lacks in some areas but is hosted on campus, you may be able to work with other branches of your administration to cover them. For example:

* Talk to your school's IT department about fortifying WiFi during your event or renting access points and switches. This can sometimes be done for free or with a security deposit. Supportive administration may help you set it up if requested.
* If you don't have access to the venue's fuse box, talk to the school's electricians to see if you can get special access or have one of them on site/on call.
* If you don't have enough extension cords or power strips, other organizations on campus may have them and be willing to lend them out. e.g. the organization that runs your school's career fair.

### Ask About Venue Requirements and Restrictions

Most venues come with their own specific list of rules and required fees. In addition to confirming what your venue provides, a few questions to ask during your initial meeting with the venue bookers include:

* Can the venue confirm and guarantee a financial ceiling for any of your quotes?
* Does the building require you to pay for catering, security, a fire marshal, janitors, etc.?
  * Is food required to be from their caterer or can you bring in outside food?
* Does the venue have a loading dock for deliveries?
* Are there specific security regulations you must abide by?
* Are you permitted to host an overnight event? It’s important to let the potential venue know that people will be working in the space overnight. The key word here is "working" -- in many instances, it is against fire code to allow attendees to sleep.&#x20;
* Does the venue require you or any sponsors attending to have insurance? Get the details and tell all parties you need this for as soon as possible.&#x20;

## MLH Tips

* Book early!
* Watch out for hidden fees and venue restrictions and requirements.
* Your venue should be free! Do everything in your power to ensure you don’t have to deal with the cost and logistical headache of paying for a space and everything that comes with it.
* Negotiate to reserve your venue for the day before so you have plenty of time to set up.
* **Make sure your space is aware your will be hosting an overnight event.**

================================================
# Mentorship

People are interested in spending time learning about new projects and meeting new people as much as they are in having fun during the hackathon! Here are a few things you can do to organize the whole process

## Mentor Recruitment

To encourage mentors to help out at the event, spend some time thinking about ways to bring value to the mentors. We recommend reaching out to existing tutors or teaching assistants to mentor because they already find the value out of mentoring and teaching others. Invite alumni from your school, industry professionals, and your professors to join during shifts throughout the event.

To facilitate the process, set up a webpage mentioning a mentor's responsibilities as a mentor for your hackathon. Set up a form to get the interested people to register, asking them to pick a timeslot to help facilitate mentorship.

### **Quality of mentorship**

Mentorship is one of the key ways your hackers can get the help they need and be the difference between them finishing a project or not.

As your team finalizes mentorship, we highly encourage creating a guide to help elevate the quality of your mentors and include items like: questions to ask hackers, how to troubleshoot with the hacker, and useful beginner tools/resources.

## Day of Management

Managing mentors during the day-of means can be enhanced by taking advantage of your chat platform. To make a smooth process for everyone, we recommend to set up the following

* Give slots to each mentor so that they know their timings better, though encouraging them to be present throughout the hackathon
* Create a #mentorship channel for hackers know where to ask for help and mentors know where to look for requests&#x20;
* Create an @mentor role and add all mentors to there so hackers can easily differentiate mentors
* Have a set of guidelines for mentors on what to do during mentorship, giving them a process
* Encourage volunteers to stay alert on Discord to look for hackers who need help and push them to the above-mentioned mentorship channel.
* Have a dedicated mentor area that hackers can walk up to with questions

## Connecting Mentors to Hackers

As often as possible, encourage mentors to hop on voice and/or video chats with the hackers seeking help, or for In-Person events go to the hacking space where the team is.

* Have organizers be active on chat and see if some hackers have problems, connecting them to mentors accordingly
* Ask mentors to be active on the chat channel
* Have mentorship office hours: A peer group type of experience where people can ask questions during the assigned time.

# Hacker Experience




================================================
FILE: general-information/day-of-logistics-and-hacker-experience/closing-ceremony.md
================================================
# Running Closing Ceremony

Once you’ve selected your winners for the event, it's time to announce them in a closing ceremony! Having a closing ceremony ensures that hackers get enough recognition of their achievements and your other supporters also get a chance to say a final word to your attendees. It also helps everyone to sum up with the same energy they had during the start of the hackathon and reflect on the great experience they had overall! Typically we have seen the following best practices for hosting a closing ceremony:

* When the closing ceremony is coming up make an announcement saying that the closing will be starting soon.&#x20;
* Talking over slides is the best format for this. In advance, ask your sponsors to give you a list of their prize winners.&#x20;
* Make sure to inject a lot of energy and excitement into your announcements!&#x20;
* This is a big moment for your event, and ending strong is super important — people tend to remember the beginning and the end of an event afterwards for years to come.&#x20;
* Make sure you celebrate all the hackers' achievements, what they were able to build and what that means!
* Having a playback of their submission video can be a great way to showcase projects as well. Keep in mind that if you have any live demos that setup time and running over take more time than you think. Plan for 10 minutes for each team that live demos(with 3 for actual demo time and 1-2 for the crowd to ask questions, and the rest for setup/swapping to the next group). We recommend instead encouraging hackers to see each others projects while final deliberations for judging is going on instead of live demos at closing ceremony.&#x20;

  Time to start planning how you’re going to make your event fun for hackers.
  We’ve brainstormed some fun activities you can do.

# Fun Mini Events

Most hackathons have a couple fun events as a break from hacking and more technical focused workshops. Activities can range from simple chat activities for a better introduction to facilitate a conversation to more active games to play.&#x20;

You can make the brainstorming events a fun activity by involving your organizing team. Have a different gaming round for each and selecting the best of them to be hosted at your event. This can be a great team-building activity as well!

To support you better, we’ve collected some fun activity options for what you can do. The following link has some examples from other events, and the rest of this page has more digital focused examples.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../organizer-resources/host-exciting-mini-events/" %}
[host-exciting-mini-events](../../organizer-resources/host-exciting-mini-events/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## **Activities via Slack/Discord**

Start discussions in threads on your **#random**, or create specific channels for chatting. See below for some potential questions you can use as conversation starters.

* **Two Truths and a Lie**
  * Hackers post two truths and a lie about themselves. Folks vote via emoji and react if they think 1, 2, or 3 is the lie. After a bit, they reveal what the lie was.
* **Question of the Hour**&#x20;
  * Stimulate the conversation by asking a “question of the hour” on Discord/Slack. Potential Ice breaker questions include:&#x20;
    * What’s your coffee/tea order?&#x20;
    * What’s your #1 Bucket List item?&#x20;
    * What city would you love to move to?&#x20;
    * What’s your favorite meal?&#x20;
    * What useless fact do you know?&#x20;
    * What is your favorite book?&#x20;
    * What’s your school mascot?&#x20;
    * What’s your go-to karaoke song?&#x20;
* **Trivia Tournament**
  * Host a trivia tournament and let hackers know it’s honors system to not google answers. You could do this via stream where the first hackers to chime in for the correct answer win, or you could do a multi-choice quiz that you distribute via Slack/Discord.&#x20;

## **Online Gaming**

Online game tournaments are one of the most common ways to engage folks. You can get creative with the games you’re hosting. Due to the processing power needed to stream, keep in mind the capabilities of your computer. We recommend streaming in no higher quality than 720p @ 30fps and hard-wiring your computer to the network via an ethernet cable when possible. Also, try not to do processing-heavy work on the computer that’s streaming.

There are numerous online gaming tournaments, and here are a few ideas:

* \*\*\*\*[**Jackbox games**](https://jackboxgames.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvO28maqf6AIVysDACh3ftAAQEAAYASAAEgKAfvD_BwE)**:** We highly recommend Jackbox and Jackbox- style games because they are an extremely accessible event to run. You only need 1 person to own the game for everyone to participate! _(Run it in family mode to avoid inappropriate prompts!)_
* **Stream multiplayer games –** League of Legends, Dota, Rocket League, and Smash can all be fun games to play over the web. Just be mindful that bad internet connection can make any of these games a bad time.
* Online **Chess** tournament&#x20;
* Create a **Minecraft** server for hackers to build in

## **Other Activities**

Keep in mind that not all your hackers will be video game players. Host some non-gaming activities as well. Some of our ideas are:

* [**!Light**](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/no-light/) _\*\*_– Code-in-the-dark activity where participants have 5 minutes to recreate a website without previewing the code they’re writing. Show the host’s screen so that hackers can see what everyone else built and vote on their favorite.&#x20;
* [**Slideshow Karaoke**](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/slideshow-karaoke/) – Presenter picks a random slidedeck based on suggestions from the audience. Have a volunteer present it without knowing what it is while the presenter controls the slides.&#x20;
* **Typing contest –** Host an online typing contest to see who can type the most words per minute using websites [like 10 Fast Fingers.](https://10fastfingers.com/competitions)
* **Music** – If hackers have Spotify Premium, you can stream background music on Discord. Think about hosting an organizer DJ of the hour and have hackers vote on their favorite playlists.&#x20;
* **Show and Tell –** Allow hackers to share with groups things they’ve been working on, interesting podcasts they’re listening to, a fun recipe they tried, or anything else they want to share.&#x20;
* **User Experience Design Competition –** Give hackers a limited amount of time to create a design based on a theme you announce. Have them post it in a thread on slack/discord and participants can vote on their favorite.&#x20;
* **Bob Ross painting competition using MS Paint** – Hackers can watch Bob Ross painting tutorials for free on YouTube. Have a competition to see who can recreate a Bob Ross landscape using MS Paint or other online drawing tool.&#x20;
* [**Skribbl.io**](https://skribbl.io/) – Draw and guess words with your friends and people all around the world! Score the most points and be the winner!

================================================
# Help Desk Recommendations

Communication is key. Be it the hackers, sponsors, judges, mentors or even organizers!

## **Organizer On Call**

Have a help desk / organizer table setup at all times. Tell hackers and sponsors they can stop by to ask questions or just hang out. Having a central location helps guide hackers who need help at any time during the event.&#x20;

## **Announcing Updates**

The help desk can also be in charge of sending updates into your chat channel throughout the event. Remind people when activities are happening and share highlights from your activities! Expect questions to pop us as you announce an event, so give some buffer time for questions.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Don’t forget to set up Discord roles to show if someone is an organizer, hacker, sponsor, or mentor. If you're using Slack, you can utilize statuses for this information.
{% endhint %}



================================================
FILE: general-information/day-of-logistics-and-hacker-experience/opening-ceremony.md
================================================
# Opening Ceremony

An opening ceremony is an essential part of the hackathon to communicate all the necessary information one might need on the day-of to make the best out of the hackathon experience.

Opening ceremonies should be celebrated like a massive festival start, creating an energy that will stay with the hackers throughout the whole hackathon.&#x20;

In the Opening Ceremony, make sure you cover:

* What a hackathon is
* Your organizing team and how to reach them for questions
* The wifi/discord/any venue details
* The event schedule, highlighting the major deadlines
* Any sponsor content
  * Coach them to keep this short and sweet to avoid losing the attention of the audience
* Prize categories and rules
* Your MLH Coach’s 5-8 minute presentation!

Check out an example slide deck [here](https://hackp.ac/openingceremonyexample)



================================================
FILE: general-information/day-of-logistics-and-hacker-experience/workshops.md
================================================
# Workshops

Workshops are a great way to get your hackers in the mood of working on something new, something they have not experienced or tried before and help your sponsors as well by increasing their product awareness. Having workshops, webinars etc. works extremely well when it comes to facilitating a conversation within the hackathon!

## **Planning your workshops**

In addition to your normal preparations for a workshop, we’re recommending you consider the following areas.&#x20;

Workshop Examples:

* Resume Building/Cracking the Technical Interview
* Day in the life of a software dev
* Intro to Python/GitHub/C#/AI/ML/Insert tech topic
* Intro to _\*insert API\*_

## Team Building Workshop

Creating an inclusive space for hackers to feel comfortable finding teammates is fundamental to a good hacker experience. To that end, it is helpful to create a #team-formation channel in your Discord/Slack and host an in-person team building workshop.

We recommend letting hackers meet each other organically in a room split into areas based on topics like gaming, AI, hardware, and more. If organizers observe that conversation is stagnating, they should go around and introduce hackers to each other and help them find common technical ground or project ideas. Team formation workshops generally don't last over an hour.

## Brainstorming Project Ideas Workshop

Brainstorming a project idea is the most important part of the hacker's experience at a hackathon, and for some hackers, it's also the most difficult.

Usually, hackers take one of two approaches:

* **Start with a problem they want to solve** and then develop an idea to solve it. Hackers who want to focus on improving an aspect of their lives or hacking for social impact might prefer this route.
*   **Start with a technology they want to use** in their hack and then develop a hack around it. Hackers who want to learn about a popular or emerging

    technology might prefer this route.

Running a hands-on workshop covering brainstorming techniques at the start of your hackathon will enable them to hit the ground running.&#x20;

### Pitch Session

Most events have a pitch session as part of their team-building session. A pitch session is a structured event where hackers who have ideas for hacks and are looking for teammates present their ideas to an audience. Typically, presenters describe the problem or technology they want to design their hack around and what skill set they're looking for. Hackers who are looking for teams and have the matching skill set can offer to join the presenter.

## **Hosting your workshops**

You should prompt your attendees for active participation. You’ll need to focus on keeping your participants engaged and active.&#x20;

For workshops with fewer attendees, we recommend starting with an icebreaker to ensure everyone knows each other. One of our favorite ice breakers is to ask each attendee to share their name, where they go to school, and something cool they learned about recently. You should also build time into your schedule to do breakout sessions, troubleshooting, and questions.

As you’re working through the workshop content, be extremely aware of how intimidating code reviews and questions will be for participants. Remind participants that if they’re facing an issue others probably are as well. You might want to have a backup speaker walking around to help troubleshoot for those who start falling behind and ask them to share their screen to troubleshoot their issues.

## **After the workshop**

When you finish the material in your presentation make sure to sign off and thank everyone for their participation. Encourage the presenter to continue hanging out with attendees. Have a channel in slack/Discord so hackers can ask follow-up questions about the workshop topic after it ends.&#x20;

You are going to need several tables and volunteers to set up, distribute, and clean up for each meal you provide. Try to avoid having all of your meals at one table, even at small events this will cause long wait times and may overwhelm the team serving meals.

We recommend one of the following two table set-ups for prepared and family-style meals, so you can maximize the number of people being served at one time. This will speed up the line, and make the space less crowded.

### Distributing Meal Credits&#x20;

If you are providing your hackers with meal credits to access your school’s dining hall, we recommend that you provide the credits upon check-in. If the credits are accessible via a physical card, you can put them in your event swag bags.

### Supporting Hackers with Dietary Restrictions

We recommend that you store any meals that are specifically for folks with dietary restrictions at another table to avoid them being accidentally taken by the wrong person. We recommend printing out a list of hackers with dietary restrictions and checking off names as you hand them out, so you can ensure that the meals are being distributed to the right people.

### Managing your Food Supply

If your event can only accommodate one meal per person, station a volunteer at the beginning of the food line checking off each individual as they are served. If someone gets back in line, you’ll be able to see that they’ve already been served!

This method can also be helpful for quickly identifying hackers with dietary restrictions, and redirecting them to a separate line.

### Meal Announcements

If you make one big announcement that dinner is being served, it is likely that all the hackers will rush to grab food all at once and then end up in a big line. As a hacker, waiting in a 20-minute line to receive food may be frustrating.

To avoid long food lines, your team can release 1-3 tables/rooms to go get food at a time. Make a series of small announcements, and then a final call to everyone.

# Hackathon Communication Platform

## **Communication Platform**

**Pick a communication platform and ensure your hackers join it**. Slack and Discord are two of the most popular. We recommend Discord for your event because of their free voice chat capabilities.

Before joining and once on the platform, make hackers know that their behavior and actions are still subject to MLH Code of Conduct, and to be respectful. _**Digital spaces can increase harassment as people are hidden behind a computer, so it is key to make sure your attendees know you still take this seriously.**_

### **At a minimum include the following channels on your platform:**

* **Team-Formation:** Channel for hackers to form teams
* **Carpool-Search:** Channel for hackers to find a ride from other hackers
* **Ask-Organizers:** Channel for hackers to ask organizers any questions that come up throughout the event.&#x20;
* **Introductions:** Channel for hackers to introduce themselves. Have your team set the norm for this by introducing yourselves.&#x20;
* **Random:** Channel for anything that isn't hackathon related.&#x20;
* **Ask-Mentors:** Channel for hackers to connect with mentors when they need help on their projects.&#x20;
* **Mentors-Internal:** Channel for mentors to talk with each other and with organizers.&#x20;
* **Admin:** Channel for your organizing team. We recommend creating an admin voice channel as well!&#x20;

Here is an example from an event Discord!

*   Note that there are 2 "sponsor" channels here so that sponsors have a dedicated space to talk about their api's or workshops.&#x20;

================================================
# Hardware

Some events choose to have hardware available for hackers to check out during the event. MLH also has a limited number of hardware labs we send to US based events. Talk to your Hackathon Community Manager about availability for your event.&#x20;

If you want to build your own hardware lab here are some recommendations. Check out if your school has a makerspace or club that does hardware related workshops and see if they can help you, they might already have some of this they can lend you!

### Setup

* **Label everything.** You may have volunteers who are not familiar with hardware checking items out. Label everything you can to make it easy to check in/out items
* Ideas on what to include
  * Raspberry Pis
  * Arduinos
  * Sensors (check out grove starter kits for potential ideas)
  * small screen/speaker
  * Extra wires/breadboards
  * A webcam (so they can put it on their hack and not be limited to their laptop camera)
* More expensive options
  * VR headset
  * 3D printer (leave at lab, have them bring you things to print)

### Checkout Process

* **Volunteer shifts.** Set up shifts before the event start. Try to get your IEEE or other hardware/engineering focused club on campus involved. Make sure there is always someone there.&#x20;
  * Having your Hardware lab near your general help desk will allow late night shifts to take care of both.&#x20;
* **Require IDs.** Holding IDs until items are returned is the best way to ensure you get your items back. Have a box for these and keep it secure at all times.&#x20;
* **Keep a log.** Keep a list of who checked what out. Only give back an ID if all is returned. This has the added benefit of seeing what hackers used so you can get more of those items next year!

================================================
# Hosting Hackers with Dietary Restrictions

Some of your hackers may have dietary restrictions that will require you to provide special accommodations. Make sure you ask anyone receiving a meal (hackers, mentors, volunteers) about their dietary restrictions before the event, so you can prepare meals with your food vendors accordingly.

### Types of Dietary Restrictions

* **Vegetarian** - No meat, and sometimes other animal products.&#x20;
* **Vegan** - No food derived from animals.&#x20;
* **Celiac Disease** - No gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley).&#x20;
* **Allergies** - Common allergies that you may run into include: Lactose and peanut allergies.
* **Kosher** - The Hebrew word “kosher” means fit or proper as it relates to Jewish dietary law.
* **Halal** - Foods that are allowed to be consumed under Islamic dietary guidelines.

### Ordering Meals&#x20;

Once you have a list of the individuals at your event with dietary restrictions you’ll need to accommodate at your event, you can either:&#x20;

1. Request one-off meals from your existing food vendors to accommodate the dietary restriction. For example, you may need to ask your food vendor to provide 3 kosher pre-packed meals.&#x20;
2. If your food vendor can not accommodate a particular dietary restriction, we recommend providing any hackers affected with a gift card to purchase food from an external food vendor. For example, if your food vendor can’t provide one of your hackers with a kosher meal then you could give that hacker a GrubHub gift card to purchase their own dinner. If you go with this method, you should notify the hacker that they will be responsible for purchasing their food before the event so they can prepare accordingly.

### Distributing Meals&#x20;

We recommend that you store any meals that are specifically for folks with dietary restrictions at another table to avoid them being accidentally taken by the wrong person. We recommend printing out a list of hackers with dietary restrictions and checking off names as you hand them out, so you can ensure that the meals are being distributed to the right people.

# Ordering Swag and Prizes

When it comes to prizes and swag, you should do what your budget allows. While swag is great for marketing/branding, you do not want to sacrifice quality of the other aspects of your event.&#x20;

## Prizes

Prizes are a great way to reward hackers for their hard work. When selecting them, it’s important to consider why you are giving a prize, what sort of behaviors that prize rewards, and how you can go about motivating those behaviors. No one wants to be seen as stingy, but prizes say a lot about who you are as a community, why you are there in the first place, and they influence the vibe of your event — big time. Check out [this article](https://news.mlh.io/are-hackathon-prizes-the-worst-thing-since-moldy-sliced-bread-04-18-2014) for a larger discussion on hackathon prizes.

While cash prizes are easy for events, we do not recommend them. The perceived value of a cash prize is much lower than traditional prizes.

Save the receipts for any prizes. If a winning team has 3 members instead of 4 you can return the prize to add to the next year's budget. You could also raffle the extra prizes or do social media challenges.&#x20;

_Many cool items will be backordered. Order prizes early to have them in time._&#x20;

## Prize Ideas

### Gear – Cool Items To Use With Future Hacks

* [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculusvr.com/order/)
* [Arduino kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001)

### Budget Conscious Prizes

Numbers may vary, but when collected these options were approximately these ranges.&#x20;

| $25+                                | $50+                             | $75+                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |

## Swag

Lanyards/Wristbands are an easy piece of swag to help make it easier to identify who has checked in and is supposed to be in your venue space. We recommend doing lanyards or wristbands at the very least. If you are making lanyards, include a space for

* Name
* Pronouns
* Role (hacker, sponsor, mentor, organizer) - Potentially get different color versions so even easier to identify
* Make sure double sided so if flips around still has name visible.&#x20;
* Also include your event Discord/Slack and who to contact in case of emergency.&#x20;
* A fun alternative for pronouns is to have a sponsor print pins to add to the lanyards that hackers can pick up at check-in. Check out an example from WEHack, where they had a sponsor co-design with their event theme as a special branding perk.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1000001888.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Pins to add to Lanyards for Pronouns</p></figcaption></figure>

If you have a significant budget surplus, consider making swag bags for everyone, this can be as low cost as $5 per participant.&#x20;

If you have multiple types of swag, consider distributing the swag throughout the event at different workshops/mini-events to keep hackers engaged.&#x20;

If you plan to get t-shirts, remember to collect t-shirt sizes so you know the approximate % distribution you want of each size. You can also use the % below that we use here at MLH.&#x20;

| Type        | Percent |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Women's XS  | 1.71%   |
| Women's S   | 6.20%   |
| Women's M   | 7.07%   |
| Women's L   | 2.75%   |
| Women's XL  | 0.95%   |
| Women's 2XL | 0.30%   |
| Unisex XS   | 1.38%   |
| Unisex S    | 13.23%  |
| Unisex M    | 43.31%  |
| Unisex L    | 29.09%  |
| Unisex XL   | 9.82%   |
| Unisex 2XL  | 3.18%   |

================================================
# Prepare Your Emergency Plan

You should be hoping for the best but planning for the worst. Spend some time coming up with emergency/nightmare scenarios and build up a document with contingency plans. This document should also include emergency contact numbers and other vital information. Some examples of these scenarios include:

* A fire starts in your venue.
* Too much power gets used and a fuse in the building gets tripped.
* A hacker has a medical emergency.
* Someone is caught trying to steal something expensive like networking equipment.

The list goes on, and you should have instructions on how each one should be handled. Make sure all volunteers have access to the document and having a physical copy of it on-site can be helpful.

In terms of emergency contacts, you should include campus security, the local non-emergency police number \(not 911\) for situations that are not time-critical, and all of your main organizers, along with the times they will be available on-site.

You should also notify local emergency services that you will be hosting a large event with a lot of students, not from your school. They should have some protocol for large events and will ideally have a person on-site or on-call through the duration of the event.

It is impossible to prepare for every possible scenario, so if something unexpected happens, remember to stay calm, try to isolate the issue, and resolve it with a level head. **Make sure at least one member of your organizing team is awake and alert at all times.**

# Project Challenges

Every event has different ways to engage hackers. Having challenges for specific topics can help hackers come up with where to get started on what type of project they want to make, and can encourage them to try out things they would not have considered before. Challenges like this are usually only one winner, and you should try and make sure 1 team is not the winner of multiple tracks where possible.&#x20;

You should try and have sponsors or partners provide these challenges where possible. Not only does it keep your budget down, it also gets them directly involved! You also want to avoid having 20 different tracks at your event, as judging will quickly get messy. You should aim for 3 tracks if you have no sponsor tracks and are not doing an overall 1st, 2nd, 3rd. If sponsors/partners are helping with judging you can have more, but be cognizant of how chaotic judging deliberations can be with many categories.&#x20;

Let's review some example challenges and descriptions

* Best Sustainability Hack
  * This sustainability challenge invites you to develop a hack that provides an innovative and practical solution that promote sustainable development.
* Best Accessibility Hack
  * This accessibility challenge invites you to develop a hack that promotes accessibility and inclusion for people.
* Best First-Time Hack
  * This best first time hacker challenge is made to welcome new hackers (and those who work with beginners)! You are eligible for this category if at least half of your team is made of 1st time hackers.
* Best Data Hack
  * Come and impress us with your data visuals! Create a data visualization in your hack, or use data in a unique and innovative way.&#x20;
* Best Web3 Hack
  * Build a decentralized application and share it with the world! Create something using blockchain for this challenge.&#x20;
* Best AI Hack
  * This challenge invites you to develop an AI, or use an existing AI in your project. Be clear in your submission on what you created vs public tools you utilized in your project.
* Best Hardware Hack
  * Using your preferred hardware or hardware emulator, build a hack of your choice.&#x20;
* Best Design
  * This design challenge invites you to develop a hack with innovative and visually appealing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX).
* Best Engagement
  *   This challenge is for the attendee/s that attend the most events during the hackathon. Events include workshops, keynotes, career fairs, and fun activities. If it is on the schedule, then it counts towards this challenge!

      The purpose of this challenge is to show our hackers that you don't need to build a project at a hackathon to participate and have fun.
  * This does require extra work by your team throughout the event so you can track engagement. QR codes at each activity, a secret code they enter in a form, or another way to track attendance is needed for this challenge.&#x20;
* Jankiest Quick Fix
  * For the thrown together "If it isn't broke don't touch it" projects
  * Have a screwdriver for the prize as a fun themed tie in.&#x20;
* Best Transportation/Urban Life Hack
  * This challenge invites you to develop a hack with innovative way to impact transportation or urban life. For example, a new way to connect with your neighbors, a new way to incentivize or improve public transportation, etc.&#x20;
* Best Food Hack
  * This challenge invites you to develop an innovative hack related to food. For example, a way to reduce food waste, a way to find new places to eat, etc.&#x20;
* Best Art Hack
  * This challenge invites you to develop a hack related to art. For example, a new way to find pop up art exhibits, a place to learn more about historical pieces, etc.&#x20;

# Setup your Event

#### Things to Print Before

* Signage -some pointing left, right, or blank so you can fill in the arrow as you place them
  * Checkin (include some pointing up to put on glass doors or in an elevator)
  * Bathrooms
  * Hacker Space
  * Food/Snacks
  * Mentors
  * Organizers Only
  * Do Not Enter
  * Workshops
* Lanyards- having different colors or designs helps differentiate hackers from staff
  * Organizers
  * Volunteers
  * Mentors
  * Judges
  * Sponsors
  * Hackers
  * Blank(if the above run out for some reason have 10-15 blank)
* Parking Passes(if needed)
* Minor Forms(if needed)
* Table Numbers (for Judging) - better to over than under print these

#### Before the Event

Here are common supplies you should have for your hackathon

* First Aid Kit&#x20;
* Permanent Markers&#x20;
* Paper&#x20;
  * Last minute signage&#x20;
  * Give out wifi&#x20;
  * Parking passes&#x20;
  * Link to Discord&#x20;
* Box Cutters / Scissors&#x20;
  * To open all your/your sponsors swag&#x20;
* Painters Tape&#x20;
  * Do not use Scotch tape on paint. It will rip away the paint and make your venue mad. It also is not likely to last the full event&#x20;
* Gaffer's Tape&#x20;
  * Secure electrical cords if they absolutely have to be across walkways&#x20;
* Duct Tape&#x20;
  * Jack of all trades tape. DO NOT USE ON PAINT

It's important to check that the various tools you're using for your event are ready to go day-of. A dry run of the whole event largely can also help your team be prepared to handle everything and let you know about any bottleneck that might create problems later on.

#### Day-Of

* [ ] Set up tables and chairs
* [ ] Make sure WiFi is working (or set it up)
* [ ] Check power at every table (may need to lay cable)
* [ ] Check-in station
* [ ] Sponsor and swag area
* [ ] Hackathon space
* [ ] Speaking area
* [ ] Judging space
* [ ] Hardware room or table&#x20;
* [ ] Food area
* [ ] AV and tech
* [ ] Relaxation area (if providing)
* [ ] Help desk/info center
* [ ] Meditation room

================================================
FILE: general-information/event-logistics/transportation-or-travel-plans.md
================================================
# Transportation/Travel Plans

## Organizing Transportation

Travel Reimbursement can help you encourage hackers from further away to attend your event. After reviewing the information below, watch our short [transportation webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGKX\_koCPIk) to ensure your transportation planning runs smoothly. **It is not required** for you to provide travel reimbursement in order to put on a successful hackathon.&#x20;

Regardless of the transportation you are able to help with, we recommend adding a carpool channel to your event communication platform (Discord/Slack are common). This allows hackers to connect with others who might be coming from the same area.&#x20;

## Travel Information Pack

We also recommend providing a plan for the best way to get to your university from common places nearby (airport/s, Greyhound/Amtrack stations, etc). HackUTD has a "[Travel Hackerpack](https://hackutd.notion.site/Travel-Hackerpack-e4dd9f55947b46a89bd95fd6dd4e08a7)" to help students find a way to the event. Here are some key highlights.&#x20;

* Include who they should contact for help/if they are running late
* Include different options to reach your venue. Hackers may have different budgets, and having an idea what the approximate cost/time for options will help them decide the best way to get there. Hackers from out of town will not be familiar with your local transportation, so if there is a school bus route include that information!
* Make sure to include your venue address and a parking map for any attendees who are driving. Also include if they need to print or collect a parking pass to put in their vehicle at checkin.&#x20;

## Travel Reimbursements

You may want to issue travel reimbursements for some or all of your attendees. A few tips:

* Email attendees via a service like SendGrid or MailChimp with instructions about how to claim their reimbursements. Include a clear timeline with receipt due dates.&#x20;
* Include information in the FAQ on your website on amount and and eligibility criteria
  * Some events have different caps based on difference or carpooling.&#x20;
  * For example, an event may do up to $25 of gas reimbursement if over X miles away but under X miles, but you may be eligible for up to $50 if you bring another hacker with you.
  * A hacker flying in might have a larger eligible amount, but might be limited to first X hackers who request it and they must get an approval email before the event.&#x20;
* Have hackers upload receipts. All should clearly show price and date of purchase to qualify.
* Send reimbursements
* Keep all receipts for tax purposes

## Charter Buses

Charter buses are typically the most affordable option for getting hackers to and from your event. Keep in mind as you plan that most buses fit 56 attendees, and the average cost per weekend is $3,300 (based on 31 hackathons in Spring 2014). Your hackathon date matters as well: for example, bus prices are often higher in April because so many schools charter them during that month for class trips.

1. **Determine how many seats you’ll need**
2. Reach out to student leadership at participating schools to find out how much interest there is in a bus. Have your contact create a Facebook event with the bus boarding time and ask them to invite as many people from the school that they want to.
3. Some interested students won’t show up when it’s time to board; we recommend ordering one 56-seat bus per 70 "yeses"
4. Dishing out seats on a first come, first serve often works best

**2. Create a travel itinerary**

* Exact locations of pick-up and drop-off points
* Contact info for a point person at the destination and arrival locations
* Trip duration and distance

**3. Collect quotes**

* Use [BusRates.com](http://www.busrates.com/) to sort bus companies by number of buses available, number of seats, bus ages, and cost. We recommend only requesting quotes from companies with 4 star ratings or above.
* [Bus.com](https://www.bus.com/) allows you to organize buses to your event in a central dashboard and request quotes directly from bus companies. They also will help you compare and find the cheapest bus company. The companies on Sharethebus are pre-vetted so you don't have to worry about ratings.
* Questions to ask
  * How much will tip, tolls, hotels, fuel, and taxes cost?
  * Can the company provide proof of insurance and US D.O.T numbers?
* Create a quote spreadsheet for each route and every company you requested info from. Include company name, price, contact info, number of buses available, etc.

## MLH Tips

* Local bus companies are usually much cheaper than national ones because national companies typically sublease from local companies. (So there’s a markup)
* Adding stops to a route doesn’t cost more money
* Plan for buses to arrive 30 min before pick-up time and stay 15 mins after drop-off
* Bus companies like to send email spam. When soliciting quotes, use a bus-only email address to keep your inbox clean.
* Don’t be cheap. Watch the Transportation Webinar below to hear some stories about why it’s important to pay for quality buses

================================================
# Working with Food Vendors

Food is an important part of a hacker’s experience. Shared meals can help bring hackers together, and give them the brain fuel they need to build their projects. Each food vendor will have different order requirements and delivery schedules. Below are some recommendations to help you have a successful relationship with your food vendors.

### Venue Requirements&#x20;

Often times venues will require you to use their catering services, especially universities. Before you start to evaluate food vendors or put in any orders, make sure you see if your venue has any requirements first.

### Ordering&#x20;

We recommend that you place your order 2-4 weeks prior to your event. If you use the venue's catering company, they may require you to finalize your order sooner.

Delivery If your vendor is delivering the food to your venue, make sure you are scheduling the drop-off at least 30-60 minutes before you plan to serve the food. You don’t want the food to get cold, but you also want to allow enough buffer time in case the delivery arrives late.

When you put in your food order, you should be specific about where the food should be delivered and who they should contact upon arrival. Give them a backup phone number in case the first organizer doesn’t pick up.

If your food vendor is providing a family-style meal (on large platters meant for sharing, rather than as individual plates) they will need more time to set up. We recommend scheduling the drop-off for 60-90 minutes prior to the meal start time. In this case, we don’t have to worry about food getting cold because it’s likely they will be using chafing dishes to warm up the food. However, some venues have restrictions on the use of chafing dishes due to them involving flammable material, so check the rules before you plan on using them.&#x20;

### Distributing Meals

If your food vendor is providing a family-style meal make sure you coordinate with them on who will be serving the food. Some vendors like university catering services have special requirements that require you to utilize their staff for food distribution and preparation.

When putting in the initial order, make sure to ask how the food vendor how they would like you to return the chafing dishes, table cloths, and other reusable goods. If they plan on picking up the goods after the meal and helping you clean up, make sure you coordinate a time in advance. You don’t want to be left with tables full of leftover food, and dishes after a meal with no plan.

We recommend also getting allergen details and posting a "Menu" at checkin so hackers can see what the options are for meals ahead of time. Here is an example from an event.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Menu-1.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>An example Menu courtesy of HackUTD</p></figcaption></figure>

### Negotiating&#x20;

If you’re running a large-scale event, often times food vendors will put together a price quote and meal plan for you to review. Especially if the price quote was higher than you expected there is no problem in asking the food vendor to see where you can reduce costs as long as you do it politely. Below is an example of an appropriate question to ask to see if there is room for negotiation.&#x20;

> Say you’re getting charged $20 per person for dinner and that puts you over your budget. Ask the food vendor, “Is there another meal we could provide that would bring down the cost to $15? Are there changes we can make to other meals to save us money?”

### Meal Ideas

Some random meal ideas. Make sure you have dietary restriction alternatives available! Especially Gluten-Free

* Thai&#x20;
* Pasta
* Tacos/burritos
* Boxed Lunch/Sandwiches
* Nice pizza - not the cheap stuff
* Halal/Gyros/Falafel
* Mediterranean/Grain Bowls
* Breakfast Tacos

# Hackathon Budgeting

Budgets are the main starting point in determining how much your sponsorship requirements for the hackathon will be. It also helps determine the logistical load your organizing team is looking to take on and which tools and services can help you do your best and most productive work in an economical way.

The best starting point of making a budget is always using an excel sheet writing down the main tools/ services you're taking into account and the different other things that will make up the best experience for your hackers.

## Major Costs to Consider

* **Food:** Providing hackers with food is one of the major costs associated with any hackathon. Everyone expects their dietary restrictions to be fulfilled alongside having high quality good at the hackathon. This comes in as one of the major aspects of hacker experience at almost any hackathon we have seen.&#x20;
  * You want to make sure you have enough food, but are also not being wasteful. If you plan on ordering extra food talk with a nearby shelter you could bring extras to after meal time. Keep in mind that you will have to do this quickly to keep the food at the right temperature to still be safe for consumption.&#x20;
  * You also might want to order less food as the hackathon progresses to be cost efficient.&#x20;
    * The [HackUTD](https://hackutd.co/) team shared these stats with us using information gathered at checkin and each mealtime with QR code scans from their platform called [HackPortal](https://github.com/acmutd/hackportal). "At a high level theres usually \~90% claim rate (out of total registrations) for 1st day lunch, \~80% Dinner, midnight snack \~70%, \~30% breakfast and 60% day 2 lunch. These stats are not including what we give to sponsors, volunteers, mentors and organizers, so depending on those numbers we usually order a fixed amount of more food for each meal. These are generalized stats from the portals I have access to. Most of them are in a +/-10% range to these numbers. The location of the hackathon can impact these numbers - for instance, \[if an event] didn't let anyone leave the building... I suspect their %s \[would be] higher."
* **Communication Platform** for building up conversations within the hackathon.  It can also be used for announcements or updates and to share resources with hackers. This is usually free but if you want to upgrade the platform(for example paying for Discord Nitro) you should budget the costs. _Recommended Platform: Discord_
* **Swag**: "Stuff We All Get" T-shirts, stickers, water bottles, lanyards, etc.
  * We recommend not getting white t-shirts as they frequently end up being see through depending on the quality. &#x20;
* **Prizes:** Though giving out prize money might seem like an easier option, we recommend giving out something that can help hackers learn, grow and utilize for their personal development.&#x20;
* **Web Hosting/ Internal Toolings:** One of the starting costs for any hackathon. Though these are one of the most important costs which might get overlooked we recommend checking out the [GitHub Education Student Developer Pack](https://hackp.ac/github) and different open source alternatives for the tools you might be paying for unnecessarily.

Before you can begin asking for money, get a sense of how much cash you need to pull off your hackathon. Create a [budget template based on estimated costs and your expected number of attendees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit).

Note: We recommend you build in a buffer of $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size of the event. In our experience, organizers will **always** need this extra money. If you don't, you now have a head start for next year!

### Helpful Figures

Over the years we've found the averages costs for major budget items are as follows (US Hackathons):

* **Food:** $8-10 per person per meal
* **Snacks & Drinks:** $10 per person
* **T-Shirts:** $5-8 per person (dependent on volume)
* **Buses:** $3,500 per bus

# Cheat Sheet: Emailing Your Sponsors

{% hint style="info" %}
Your first email should **NEVER** contain links, hyperlinks, attachments, or images. Many companies have IT policies that automatically trash new external emails with these to prevent phishing. Do not send your sponsorship prospectus, meeting invite link, website link, image in signature, etc. in your first email. Include them in a follow-up message 1-2 weeks after the initial email!
{% endhint %}

| **An engaging angle for the sponsor**                                      | Connect your sponsor with an element of your hackathon that they'll be familiar with and interested in hearing more about.                         | I see that you’ve been working with blockchain integration — we are really excited about a blockchain track we’re incorporating into our hackathon!                                                      |

# Introduction to Fundraising

Landing quality sponsorships is manageable if you **break the process into small steps** and give yourself plenty of lead time. The more practice you get approaching and negotiating with potential backers, the better you’ll become at the art of fundraising.

One thing to keep in mind as you work your way through this process: **sponsors are like investors — they want to see you’re serious before they give you capital**. In the same way you wouldn’t approach for venture capital without a product prototype, don’t reach out to sponsors until you’ve got evidence that your hackathon is well on its way to happening. Examples of this include a confirmed date and time, pre-registrations from students, etc.

With the **right communication and target**, you can expect a lot of positive response from the sponsors' side. Remember to be diligent about communicating with your sponsors at every step of the process. Explain to them the **reasons** for hosting your event, outline how you will **support them** throughout the event, and let them **know about the success** of other hackathons.

* **Prize categories** and **Workshops** are both major perks sponsors like to get involved in the hackathons they are supporting. &#x20;
  * Example challenges/workshops can help them pick a topic that will have a greater impact on hackers. While they can offer a different one, a list of examples can help them if they do not know where to start.&#x20;
  * Challenge Examples:
    * Best Use of X &#x20;
      * X being their general API. Try not to have it be too specific as this will decrease the creativity of hackers.&#x20;
    * Best Sustainability/Social Good/Educational/etc Hack
      * This can allow for a general topic the company wants to encourage hackers to incorporate into their hack.
  * Workshop Examples:
    * Resume Building/Cracking the Technical Interview
    * Day in the Life of a Software Dev
    * Intro to Python/GitHub/C#/AI/ML/Insert tech topic
    * Intro to _\*their API\*_
* You can also give sponsors their **own channel on the chat platform (Slack/Discord)** to talk to hackers, and have them introduce themselves so everyone knows who they are how they can be a resource for them throughout the event. They can get great interactions with hackers across the venue, answer questions specific to their challenge, apis, or workshop content, and share information specific to their role at the event.&#x20;
* A good way to maintain company relations is by keeping in touch with them to give sponsors a chance to commit to supporting your event again the next year. We suggest sending your representatives an email of thanks to offer a recap of your event immediately after the hackathon, and rekindling this thread once you've started planning your next iteration.

### When you’re finished reading this section of the guide, we strongly recommend watching our fundraising webinar: [Raising Sponsorship - A Workshop by MLH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI9NVe2wA5w) and [Creating Compelling Sponsorships. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9miqQzxT-0)

================================================
# Potential Sponsor Perks

Hackathons can find unique and fascinating ways of involving sponsors in different aspects of their event to benefit everyone involved. The range of perks you can offer your sponsors is limitless.

## Running a Sponsored Prize

A sponsored prize track or category can significantly boost interest in your hackathon for the sponsors as well as the participants. For sponsors, this could result in new people contributing in unique ways towards their product. For hackers, this is an additional prize for them to aim for during the hackathon!

We recommend matching the value of your sponsors' prizes with the ones your team is providing for the event to avoid overshadowing other prize categories.

## Sponsor Interactions

If your sponsors are running a prize track, request that they bring a representative who is familiar with their challenge so hackers can ask questions, get feedback, and talk to them about the track. This is the best way to guarantee meaningful interactions between hackers and sponsors, and often leads to better project quality and sponsor satisfaction.

We also recommend having your sponsors send someone to actively mentor and start conversations with hackers. You should also encourage them to monitor a sponsor-specific channel for their company in your Slack/Discord where they can respond at all times.

## Workshops

This is a great way of keeping your hackers engaged and increasing the presence of your sponsors. Be mindful of balancing turnout with hacker morale; you will have a hard time getting anyone to attend a Sunday workshop (with Pitching Your Project or Submitting Your Project as the only exceptions) because hackers will be exhausted by then. Try to schedule all your workshops on Friday/Saturday and hold introductory workshops early on to give hackers enough time to experiment with what they learn.&#x20;

The [Introduction to Fundraising](introduction-to-fundraising.md) page has some examples of sponsor-hosted workshops.&#x20;

## Fun and Games

As you’re hosting games and competitions throughout the event, mix it up with sponsor vs hacker vs organizers challenges! If your sponsor isn’t as interested in technical workshops, see if they’re interested in hosting a mini-event or game. Some sponsors don't think they are allowed to participate in the fun mini-events, so encourage one of your organizers (potentially your sponsorship lead) to go around before mini-events to get the sponsors to come take a break and hang with hackers! You can check out some mini-event ideas under our [Host Exciting Mini-Events](../../organizer-resources/host-exciting-mini-events/) section.&#x20;

## Recruiting

One perk many sponsors find valuable is strengthening their talent pipeline by talking to hackers. Depending on the time of year, your sponsors may be interested in participating in various opportunities.  If a sponsor is primarily interested in recruiting, there are several ways to engage them. Some nonexhaustive ideas include:

* **Resume critiques** – Office hours where recruiters help hackers edit and perfect their resumes.&#x20;
* **1:1 Recruiter/Sponsorship Fair** – A dedicated space where hackers can chat with sponsors/ recruiters about anything: their resume, job expectations, company culture, etc. &#x20;
* **Interviews** – If you’re providing resumes in advance, your recruiters may be interested in interviewing your hackers during the event. We recommend using a dedicated office-style space to respect the privacy of the interview process.

  Before approaching sponsors, create a short informational packet with three
  tiers of sponsorship.
---

# Sponsorship Prospectus

{% hint style="info" %}
Your first email should **NEVER** contain links, hyperlinks, attachments, or images. Many companies have IT policies that automatically trash new external emails with these to prevent phishing. Do not send your sponsorship prospectus, meeting invite link, website link, image in signature, etc. in your first email. Include them in a follow-up message 1-2 weeks after the initial email!
{% endhint %}

Sponsorship prospectuses (also called sponsorship packets) don't need to be fancy. They should explain what a hackathon is and [what perks sponsors can expect](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/getting-sponsorship/potential-sponsor-perks) in exchange for their support. Providing examples of how sponsors have been involved at other hackathons can be a great starting point for companies to think about what tier is right for them.

## Your prospectus should:

* **Be 2-3 pages long:** Sponsors generally don't have time to read through a big sponsorship deck.
* **Be legible:** Less is more! Choose a uniform color scheme and keep text to a minimum on each slide.
* **Highlight the Basics**: Be sure to include the following info on _all_ promotional materials — we can’t tell you how many times this gets overlooked!
  * Event name
  * Date
  * Projected attendance
  * Website URL
  * Contact email
* **Cover the story behind your event:** This includes a brief introduction to your team, what you’re trying to accomplish, and crucially, what makes your event unique.
* **Include an overview of available sponsorships:** Companies should be able to easily identify the benefits and differences between each tier and how much they cost.
  * We recommend including three sponsorship tiers: reasonable, moderate, and expensive. (Your most expensive tier should not be more than 25% of your budget.)
  * Let companies know that custom packages are available upon further negotiation with your team's email address. We recommend including this message at the bottom of the tier overview page for easy access.

## Tier Breakdown

No two events' sponsorship prospectuses will be the same because your sponsor pools will be interested in different benefits. When assigning perks to your tiers, we recommend having each tier build upon the level directly below it. You'll get a better sense of how to optimize perks based on sponsor interest from previous iterations of your hackathon, but we suggest having your lowest tier start with a set of basic perks that fall under general, publicity, and recruitment categories.

Here are some examples of [previous sponsor decks](https://github.com/MLH/hackathon-organizer-guide/blob/master/Organizer-Resources/Previous-Sponsorship-Decks) that organizers gave us permission to share. Reach out to your Hackathon Community Manager for more advice!

  Once you’ve assessed how much money your hackathon needs and created your
  sponsorship materials, you’re ready to embark on the fundraising process.
---

# The 5-Step MLH Sponsorship Process

## 1. Do Your Research

* Compile a list of potential sponsors.
  * Check out sponsors of [previous MLH events](https://mlh.io/seasons/2025/events), particularly local ones.
  * Search your network (LinkedIn is a great tool for this).
  * Check in with career services at your university — which companies sponsor tech job fairs on your campus?
  * Diversify your sponsor profile by reaching out to startups, midsized enterprises, and large enterprises.
  * Make fundraising announcements to your community.

## 2. Get In Touch

* Send a well-crafted, thoughtful email.
  * Remember to include an introduction of yourself so sponsors know who they're talking to!
  * Check out our [Sponsor Emails Cheat Sheet](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/getting-sponsorship/cheat-sheet-emailing-your-sponsors) to learn what to include and avoid in the body of your message.
  * Your first email should **NEVER** contain links, hyperlinks, attachments, or images. Many companies have IT policies that automatically trash new external emails with these to prevent phishing. Do not send your sponsorship prospectus, meeting invite link, website link, image in signature, etc. in your first email. Include them in a follow-up message 1-2 weeks after the initial email!
* Reach out to the relevant decision maker at each company. When in doubt, email the CEO.&#x20;
  * Other useful job titles:
    * Developer Relations - aka Dev Rel
    * Marketing/Recruiting/HR
  * These contacts will either directly have the budget to support your event or know who to put you in touch with.&#x20;
* Follow up: don’t worry if you don’t receive a response to your initial email! Your contact may have lost your email or simply had a busy week. Wait 1-2 weeks (3-4 days if close to your event date) and ask again; you should ping the contact up to 3 times.

## 3. Hop on an Exploratory Phone Call

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that sponsors haven't received your prospectus at this stage, so practicing a brief elevator pitch based on the information in your packet is a great starting point for this call.
{% endhint %}

* Help the sponsor understand what a hackathon is. Offer analogies such as comparing it to a science fair.&#x20;
* Sell your team and your story. What makes your hackathon special?
  * Get the prospect excited about the event.  Be sure to share personal experiences about the impact and takeaways of hackathons.&#x20;
* Ask about success metrics. What did they ask for in previous sponsorships?
* Let them do the talking! You’ll figure out the company's primary values this way.&#x20;
  * Prompt your contact with guiding questions. You want to make the call as conversational as possible so you can learn their goals while sharing your own experiences and expertise to build trust and credibility.
* Don’t be afraid to ask for their budget. "Given the times you’ve sponsored events similar to this one, what have you spent and what did you get out of it?"
* Before you hang up, schedule a follow-up call.

## 4. Make A Proposal

* Do this immediately after your call. Sometimes it’s as easy as sending over your prospectus and highlighting the pre-made packages most relevant to that particular company. Other times, you’ll have to put together a custom proposal.
* Explain why your proposal is a good fit for the sponsor.
* Give your sponsorship deadline.

## 5. Follow Up And Track Your Progress

* Email a week or two after sending your initial proposal by offering to answer questions.
* Track your emails with a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool, an email service like Boomerang, or a manual platform like Excel.
* When a sponsor says yes, invoice them immediately. Create a contract for them to finalize their funding amount and method of payment. Make sure they are paying to an account you can easily access with a currency you can accept.

  Before setting your goals and starting to reach out to sponsors, it's
  extremely necessary to understand them and their perspective towards
  supporting hackathons.

# Understanding Your Sponsors - Who to Reach Out to

Sponsorship is one of the most crucial parts of every hackathon. When you're reaching out to sponsors, it's necessary to understand their perspective of supporting your hackathon and the outcome they're expecting out of it. You should consider this as a sales pitch for your hackathon. To understand it further, let's first understand the different types of sponsors hackathons generally target to.

## Hackathons target five categories of sponsors:

* **Financial/ Monetary Sponsors** — Companies that pay for services like having their logo on your website (most sponsors fall into this category).
* **Presenting Sponsors** — Companies that co-host or co-brand your event (be careful not to give up too much control here). Think of them as a premium Fiscal Sponsor.
* **In-kind Sponsors** — Companies that donate services or goods like hardware or platform credits for free.
* **Strategic/ Media Partners** — Companies that help with marketing and promotion; often publications.
* **Community Partners** — Companies that can help you recruit hackers, mentors, judges, or volunteers from their community for free.&#x20;

**Please note that these are all broad categories and there will be sponsors that can fit into multiple categories at once as well.**

We often see companies attempting to give away free credits or swag to avoid paying a sponsorship fee. We recommend steering clear of these engagements or evaluating these opportunities on a case-by-case basis using the guide we wrote for you below.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="evaluating-in-kind-sponsorships.md" %}
[evaluating-in-kind-sponsorships.md](evaluating-in-kind-sponsorships.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you have enough information about what category a sponsor fits in, you should try to understand what their goal or primary reason might be to support your hackathon.

## Who should I be reaching out to?

### Sponsors support hackathons for three primary reasons:

* **To get real-time feedback on their products**, especially APIs and development tools. To find people with these goals, target job titles containing Developer Relations/Dev Rel or Developer Advocate. These people generally are familiar with hackathons and have a budget to attend them, but is usually a more niche/harder to find role.&#x20;
* **To recruit interns and full-time employees**, especially during the fall season. To find people with these goals, target job titles like Hiring, Recruiting, Talent Acquisitions, or HR. These people typically have the budget, but will likely need more explanation on what a hackathon is. &#x20;
* **To raise awareness** (or change the perception) **of their brand/ product or service**. To find people with these goals, target job titles containing Marketing or Public Relations, or an Employee Resource Group related to your primary event demographic. These people typically have a budget, but will need more information on how they are making a difference. Photos from previous events will help more with these pitches.

Apart from these three primary reasons, sponsors may want to support an event because they align with your community values, want increased engagement with their product, or have region targeted goals. Sponsors in this last category are typically companies that have a strong local presence at your college and/or career fairs. Working with them to send specific stats about your event to help their process can be a great way to improve your chances of sponsorship.

{% hint style="info" %}
We typically recommend not reaching out to a random Software Developer/Manager(or like title) at a company as it is hard for them to get budget approval to support a hackathon. If you have alumni connections, see if they can help connect you to the job titles in the bullet points above to get the needed budget!
{% endhint %}

Understanding how to target and cater to your sponsors is essential to forming your approach to addressing the most common concerns they raise.

## Sponsors’ top practical concerns:

1. **Attendee Value**
   * Are your hackathon’s attendees a good fit for the company in terms of recruiting, marketing, etc.?
   * How hard is it for companies to reach this audience without your help? What unique bridge does your event offer between the sponsor and their target population?
2. **Who else is sponsoring?**
   * Depending on the sponsor, your other backers will matter. Some companies prefer to sponsor events their competitors sponsor, whereas others want to ensure they’re the biggest name on your roster.
3. **Package Value**
   * Are they getting their money’s worth?
4. **The Force (a.k.a. their gut feel)**
   * How do the sponsors feel about your competency: is the event well-organized so far? Have you been professional in all communications?

While setting your goals, take all of these points into consideration and make different categories of people you need to target. Creating specific [Sponsorship Prospectus](../sponsorship-prospectus.md) for different target companies can be a great way to help them understand the value of associating their brand with your hackathon.

# Evaluating In-kind Sponsorships

As you might have read in the [different categories of sponsors](./#hackathons-target-five-categories-of-sponsors), in-kind sponsors are those who provide goods or services instead of money as a sponsor of your event. It is important, as an organizer, to **evaluate the pros and cons of each in-kind sponsor** and make a conscious decision about whether or not to work with them.

Oftentimes, in-kind sponsors will offer to provide something that is essential to your event. This could include catering for an in-person event, the production of event swag, or even credits to host your event website or servers. While they may not directly provide money, these types of in-kind sponsorships can help to lower your overall event budget.

It is up to your team to evaluate whether or not this is worth it. **We recommend evaluating the cost-benefit for you as organizers and for your hackers.** Don't be afraid to go back to potential in-kind sponsors with counteroffers that your team is more comfortable with.

_As a thought experiment, ask yourself if you would be willing to trade the flagship sponsorship of your event to a catering company in exchange for a free meal that would have otherwise cost you $5000. What about five free meals? What if they only want a logo on the back of your t-shirt, and not the flagship-level branding? Each event is different, and you will have to ask this question about any in-kind sponsor who comes your way._

If you expect a high volume of in-kind sponsors, you could **consider developing in-kind sponsorship packages** as part of your prospectus, or directly tying the value of their contribution to the existing value of one of your sponsorship packages. In the example above, perhaps you already have a $5000 sponsorship tier that you can offer to them instead of the flagship. Keep in mind, though, that the needs of a catering or t-shirt company might be very different than that of a recruiter or developer evangelist. You may need to modify your packages to fit their needs.

**Our final recommendation is not to devalue your event sponsorships to please in-kind sponsors. Money has a specific, and quantifiable value for your event. You can directly use it to make your event better and improve the hacker experience. Be cautious of in-kind sponsors who seem to be overvaluing their contributions beyond what you might realistically spend on that budget line-item if you were not to accept their sponsorship.**

_Consider the following scenario. Perhaps there is a blog hosting company who has a free tier. In their free tier, the company logo is at the bottom of your blog. A competing blog hosting company comes to offer you an in-kind sponsorship of a superpowered blog with no company branding on it in exchange for the Gold Tier sponsorship at your event which includes a booth (or virtual speaking slot) and logo on your t-shirt and event website. It is not a clear win/lose scenario to choose between these two vendors, but you must ask yourself how valuable each of these things is to your event. If it is very important to you that your blog does not have external company branding on it, you might deem this a good deal. If you don't care about that type of branding, but you have a limited number of booths/speaking slots available at your event, maybe this is not a good deal._

We hope this is helpful, and if you ever have questions about how to evaluate in-kind sponsorship offers feel free to reach out to [league@mlh.io](mailto:league@mlh.io) for further advice!

# Hackathon Budgeting

Before you can begin asking for money, get a sense of how much cash you need to pull off your hackathon. This budget determines the sponsorship requirement for your hackathon, the logistical load of your organizing team, and the tools and services you have at your disposal.

The best starting point for your budget is an Excel sheet that tracks the categories of expenses that are essential to creating the best experience for your hackers. Create a [budget template based on estimated costs and your expected number of attendees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit).

## Major Costs to Consider

* **Food:** This is one of the most significant costs and contributors to overall hacker experience at any hackathon. Everyone expects high quality food that respects their dietary restrictions.
  * Order enough food while not being wasteful. If you plan on ordering extra food, talk to a nearby shelter or student organization you can bring extras to after meal time. Keep in mind that you will have to do this quickly to keep the food safe for consumption.&#x20;
  * You may want to order less food as the hackathon progresses to be cost efficient.&#x20;
    * The [HackUTD](https://hackutd.co/) team shared these stats with us using information gathered at checkin and each mealtime with QR code scans from their platform called [HackPortal](https://github.com/acmutd/hackportal). "At a high level there's usually \~90% claim rate (out of total registrations) for 1st day lunch, \~80% Dinner, midnight snack \~70%, \~30% breakfast and 60% day 2 lunch. These stats are not including what we give to sponsors, volunteers, mentors and organizers, so depending on those numbers we usually order a fixed amount of more food for each meal. These are generalized stats from the portals I have access to. Most of them are in a +/-10% range to these numbers. The location of the hackathon can impact these numbers - for instance, \[if an event] didn't let anyone leave the building... I suspect their percentages \[would be] higher."
* **Communication Platform:** Even if you are holding an in-person hackathon, you should host a space for digital communication. We recommend using [Discord](https://discord.com/download) as your central platform. This can be used to post announcements, updates, and hacker resources. Hosting a server is usually free, but if you want to upgrade the platform (by paying for Discord Nitro, for example) you should budget the costs.
  * If it's your first time setting up a Discord server, some useful topics to create channels for include announcements, FAQs, general, resources, and sponsor-specific questions. Ask your HCM for tips about role permissions, attendee verification, and more!
* **Swag:** Short for "Stuff We All Get." These include t-shirts, stickers, water bottles, lanyards, and more. They're a great way to spread your hackathon branding and incentivize your hackers.
  * We recommend not getting white t-shirts as they frequently end up being see through depending on the quality. &#x20;
* **Prizes:** We recommend awarding something that hackers can directly use to learn and grow for their personal development.
* **Web Hosting/ Internal Tooling:** This is one of the initial costs of organizing that tends to be overlooked. We recommend checking out the [GitHub Education Student Developer Pack](https://hackp.ac/github) for open source alternatives to the tools you might be paying for.

Note: We recommend you build in a buffer of $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size of the event. In our experience, organizers will **always** need this extra money. If you don't, you now have a head start for next year!

### Helpful Figures

Over the years we've found the averages costs for major budget items are as follows (US Hackathons):

* **Food:** $8-10 per person per meal
* **Snacks & Drinks:** $10 per person
* **T-Shirts:** $5-8 per person (dependent on volume)
* **Buses:** $3,500 per bus

FILE: general-information/hackathon-budgeting/legal-considerations.md
================================================
# Legal Considerations

There are several legal considerations you should be aware of when planning your event. If you are a student club, we recommend consulting with an advisor from your university or high school on the following legal topics before your event.&#x20;

* [ ] Donations&#x20;
  * Is our school a 501(c)(3) nonprofit? If so, can our team accept donations? How can we accept donations?
* [ ] Insurance
  * Will our event be covered by our school's event insurance? Do we need hackers to sign any agreements before participating in the event?
* [ ] Sponsor Agreements
  * Who at our school should we contact to sign legal agreements on our behalf? How long is the review process?
* [ ] Finance
  * Where will our funds be kept? How can we access them? Are there any fees we should be aware of? What is the realistic timeline for how long it takes for us to actually use the funds that come into our account?
  * Are there any tax requirements we should be aware of? Do we need to keep our receipts?
* [ ] Age Restrictions
  * Do we need waivers for high schoolers to stay at our venue overnight?

If your team is not a student organization, we recommend consulting the MLH team to help you evaluate legal alternatives. &#x20;

One common financial alternative is working with a fiscal sponsor - an existing 501(c)(3) nonprofit - to be granted their tax-exemption status and any additional financial and legal benefits. The fiscal sponsors listed below are designed to support hackathon teams. It is possible to partner with MLH while also being sponsored by any of these organizations.

* [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/?utm_campaign=other-organizers-organizer_guide_hackclub_referral\&utm_medium=website\&utm_source=partner) - A nonprofit network of high school coding clubs and makers around the world.&#x20;
* [Hack+ ](https://hackplus.io/?utm_campaign=mlh-organizers-organizer_guide_hackplus_referral\&utm_medium=website\&utm_source=partner)- An accessible nonprofit accelerator for student-led impacts. They are a full-spectrum platform that enables students to launch startups, nonprofits, and events.

# Hackathon Scheduling

## Brief Volunteers

Make your volunteers responsible for specific tasks. They should be working on something relevant at any given time during their shifts.

## Event Start:

* Serve breakfast
* Welcome and brief sponsors
* Welcome and check-in attendees
* Check ID, collect liability waivers and minor forms
* Give out promotional materials (swag or credits)
* Give attendees wrist bands or name tags

## **Opening ceremony**

> Note about speakers: Your attendee’s time is valuable. Many sponsors are going to ask for speaking spots… optimize for interesting speakers rather than lucrative speakers.\
> \
> Invite-only API demos (developer evangelists) are another good option.

* Round up people to attend presentation
* Welcome address
  * Announcements
  * Keynote speaker
  * MLH talks

## During Hacking

* Collect garbage
* Tech talk facilitator: rounding people up to listen and handling speakers (tech talks usually sponsors).&#x20;
* One volunteer should be in charge of each special area or activity at the hackathon: for example, the hardware room, photo booth, etc.
* Checking in on hackers: feeding them snacks, making sure their power and WIFI are working, etc.

## Hacking Deadline

* Get teams to submit what they’ve been working on to Devpost(or whatever you are using for project submissions). It’s important that every team member is registered on the platform and added to the hackathon project.
* MLH Tip: Announce a deadline that is an hour before your real deadline
* Have an organizer ask each team if they submitted their idea.
* If you have science-fair style judging, have hackers go eat lunch in a separate room while you reconfigure the hacking area for demos



================================================

================================================
# Detailed Run of Show

Schedules can definitely change, but it’s good for participants (and organizers) to know what to expect. Please, send us your schedule and we can help ensure it’s realistic.

Take a look at example schedules to see what makes the most sense for you. Our [sample run of show](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2B4-AYUU3Y0xFmiTGLYfRosP2IdXxF1Ud5GvGh-6cE/edit?usp=sharing), will help you create a full and complete event schedule.

Decide whether to do a 2 or 3 day hackathon. Then take a look at example schedules to see what makes the most sense for you.

All schedules include:

* Keynote opening speech
* Expo activities where sponsors can demo their apis/have a career fair/network with hackers (2 to 3 hour window)
* Hacking
* Meals and snacks
* Activities (past examples: laser tag, cup stacking competition)
* Judging - If you have multiple judging phases, be sure to block out enough time for each of them with some buffer time in between

================================================
FILE: general-information/hackathon-scheduling/run-through-with-the-team.md
================================================
# Run-Through with the Team

Just like a play or a wedding, it’s important to rehearse your schedule once with all team members.

* Create and distribute a [run-of-show document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2B4-AYUU3Y0xFmiTGLYfRosP2IdXxF1Ud5GvGh-6cE/edit?usp=sharing) with:
* A timeline including the official hackathon schedule and a secondary staff schedule denoting what needs to happen behind the scenes — and when
* Confirmed roles and report times for each team member. Sample responsibilities include:
  * Checking in guests
  * Greeting and directing attendees
  * Running social media
  * Setting out food
  * Managing transportation
  * Guiding and attending to sponsors and press
  * Running AV
  * Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

Any others?

* Physically walk-through the run-of-show document in the event space.

## MLH Tips

* Keep in mind most organizers, especially team leaders, will be responsible for more than one thing
* Hackathon schedules inevitably change. The social media point person should be in charge of communicating schedules updates via Twitter and updates to the Facebook invite as soon as they happen, as well as answering attendee questions in real time.
* Assign at least one organizer to make sure the event is going well and put out fires as needed

# Main Website

Once you've published your placeholder website, your team should immediately prioritize deploying the main hackathon website. This website should be designed to reflect your hackathon's goals and serve as the face of your event to the whole community. Great design language can significantly raise the perceived reputation of your hackathon to your attendees. Check out our [design guide](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/hackathon-website/making-an-accessible-design) for more!

### A typical hackathon website contains the following sections:

* **Landing Page:** The landing page contains your hackathon's name, logo, dates, and most importantly, your hacker registration form. We also suggest including supplementary information like judging and mentorship interest forms.
* **About the Hackathon:** This section is a space for the lengthier information about your hackathon, including the event's ambitions and motivations, a short reference of your team, etc.
* **Sponsors:** This section lends professional credibility to your hackathon by featuring your sponsor companies. Including brand assets and links to each sponsor's website is a great way to thank them for their support.
* **FAQ:** A well-written FAQ can reduce the load of your support emails and is a crucial read for anyone attending your hackathon. The following bulletpoints are formatted to be easy to copy and paste, but you should customize as needed to fit your event.&#x20;
  * Is  HACKATHON NAME free to attend?
    * Yes! Food will be provided for the duration of the event. We will also have swag and prizes!
  * Where is the event? Is it in person or virtual? Where can I park?
    * The event is located in the XXXX Building at STREET ADDRESS.
    * You can park in Lot X,Y, Z which you can see on this campus parking site - LINK
  * Who can attend? What if I don't have any experience? Do I have to be 18?
    * This event is open to any students. It is beginner friendly, with workshops to help you learn during the event, and mentors available to help you as you work on your project.&#x20;
    * Attendees must be at least 13 years old due to child privacy laws. If under 18, you will need to fill out this liability form from the university to participate - LINK.
  * What is the team size limit?
    * Teams should be between 1 and 4 people. We will have a team building activity right after opening ceremony if you'd like to find team members!
  * Are there travel reimbursements?
    * We are not able to provide travel reimbursements at this time.
  * What should I bring?
    * Your laptop, charger, headphones, deodorant, and a pillow/blanket.
  * When can we start working on our project? Can I work on a previous project?
    * You cannot start until after opening ceremony. You may come up with ideas, but are not allowed to start coding. You cannot work on a previous project, but can use frameworks if you clearly credit them in your readme and differentiate what you made vs what you used.&#x20;
  * How many challenges can I apply for?
    * As many as you want!
  * Do I have to stay overnight?
    * No, you can leave and come back if you would prefer.&#x20;
  * What kind of activities will there be?
    * We will post the schedule closer to the event. There will be workshops and activities to take a break and meet other hackers and our wonderful sponsors.&#x20;
  * What is a hackathon?
    * A hackathon is an event where students "hack" together and create an app, website, game, etc. in 24-48 hours. There will be no malicious "hacking".&#x20;
  * Will hardware be available?
    * We do not have hardware available, but you are welcome to bring your own. Due to building fire codes, soldering kits are not allowed in the venue.
  * Are you sending out acceptances? Is there a deadline to apply? Is there a waitlist?
    * We will send out acceptances XX days before the event. If you need earlier confirmation to book travel, please reach out to our team at EMAIL ADDRESS. Applications will close once we reach the maximum amount of hackers we can support, but we will open a waitlist on the day of the event for any local hackers who want to fill the spots of any accepted hackers who do not end up attending.
  * How do I sign up to be a mentor/judge/volunteer?
    * You can sign up here - LINK
  * I have a different question!
    * Email us at EMAIL ADDRESS!
* **Footnotes:** This section generally contains all the important documentation of your hackathon including the rules, code of conduct, support emails and/ or any contact form.&#x20;

### Regular website updates

Ideally, you’ve been updating your site on a rolling basis as more details get finalized. This is a great way to keep your hackers engaged and motivated to check out all the offerings at your hackathon. You'll want to add the following sections at least a month ahead of your event for the best hacker experience.

* **Schedule:** This is a great way to increase visibility and keep hackers informed of what to expect at different times during your hackathon. You should be prepared to make live edits on the weekend of your event to reflect last minute delays or room changes.
* **Venue Address and Map:** An address can help hackers from other universities find your building. A map highlighting areas for workshops, hacking, and sleep is also strongly encouraged.
* **Link to your Hackathon Chat Channel:** [Set up a single channel of communication](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/event-logistics/hackathon-communication-platform) for day-of updates.&#x20;
* **Prizes:** Get your hackers excited by publicizing your prizes!
* **Tracks:** Let hackers know about the different themes they can work upon during the hackathon.
* **Speakers, Judges & Mentors:** It's best to include information about the different people attending your hackathon with different roles to thank them and let hackers know of their presence. This will also help on the day of to manage hacker interaction.

## **MLH Tips:**

* You should update this site on a rolling basis as you land speakers and sponsors, create your schedule, confirm transportation offerings, etc.
* As early as possible, celebrate what differentiates your event.
* It's never too early to open registration. Check out [MyMLH](http://my.mlh.io) for an awesome single sign on solution to make signing up for your hackathon really simple!

# Making an Accessible Design

Creating a brand guideline and design theme for your hackathon can be one of the most rewarding ways to get your hackers excited for your event.

Your design is only as impactful as how accessible and recognizable it is to your hackers. Coming up with your hackathon's website and brand identity always starts with accessibility. Fortunately, there are many public resources that streamline the process of checking for and implementing web and visual accessibility measures. We've compiled a list of some of the most relevant ones below.&#x20;

* Web Accessibility
  * ADA Compliance Across the Web - [https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/](https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/)
  * How to Evaluate Web Accessibility - [https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/#initial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/#initial)
  * Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (v2.2) - [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)
* Visual Accessibility
  * Testing Text Size and Color - [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)&#x20;
  * Accessibility 101: Color Contrast - [https://cultureconnectme.com/color/](https://cultureconnectme.com/color/)
  * Color Contrast and Visual Design Guidelines - [https://accessibility.digital.gov/visual-design/color-and-contrast/](https://accessibility.digital.gov/visual-design/color-and-contrast/)&#x20;
  * Color Checker - [https://coolors.co/contrast-checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker)
  * Another Color Contrast option - [https://randoma11y.com/](https://randoma11y.com/)

A bonus of building your web and design foundations on top of accessibility considerations is avoiding common pitfalls later on. Simplifying your design by cutting out visually complex details and using contrasting colors will make swag production and publicity much cheaper and easier.&#x20;

Finally, your design should express how memorable and unique your event is. Pick a visual motif and color palette that can be reused from year to year to maintain the continuity of your event! Using a fun mascot and cohesive gradient creates an engaging website that you can also tie in with your in person decorations.

# Placeholder Website

Until an event has a website, it doesn’t exist to most people. Publishing a basic website the second you’ve committed to hosting a hackathon will help you drive interest to it, capture potential attendee email addresses, and answer questions from interested students. You don't have to be technically skilled to set this up! We've included a template at the bottom of this page.

_Think about your hackathon as a movie. You first release a teaser, then a trailer and then on the eventful weekend, the movie releases! This website will serve as a teaser for your event - the first step to spark a huge interest in your hackathon._

## The first iteration of your site should include:

* **Event Date:** If you don't have an exact date, try to include at least the month of your hackathon.
* **Pre-Registration Form:** Capture the initial interest of your hackers. Getting their name, email and some social channels is a great starting point to send outreach once registrations have opened up. If you plan on working with MLH, including our [required fields](../managing-registrations/registrations.md) will speed up the Member Event onboarding process.&#x20;
* **Email Support:** You should keep a team inbox to answer hacker questions. This will have a great impact on the word of mouth marketing.
* **Social Media:** Links to your event’s social media accounts. Common platforms include Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn. Staying active on these platforms helps hackers remember your event is coming up.
* **Release Date:** A date for visitors to check back for more information.
* **Frequently Asked Questions:** A basic FAQ about your event to explain things to someone new to hackathons. See the [main website page](main-website.md) for some common copy-paste questions.
* **Sponsor Interest Page:** A page just for sponsors, including:
  * An email address for sponsorship inquiries.
  * Some information about your event and your team.

description: Things to keep an eye out for
---

# Cheating Check

First of all, assume non-malicious mistakes from hackers will happen. Some of them are beginners, some may have misunderstood your instructions, or arrived late and missed opening ceremony. Make sure to post all rules on Devpost(or your other submission platform) and that you include everything you go over in your opening ceremony.&#x20;

That being said, we do see some projects submitted that cheat. This is more common for digital events. You should still check all winning projects regardless of event type for cheating.&#x20;

The following list should not result in an immediate DQ, but it should prompt you to dig deeper. Talk to the team ask who worked on what part. Ask some questions on who worked on a random bit and have them explain it. Make sure you are proud of your winners an what they made!

Here are common things to check:

* You should check their GitHub(recommended you require this as part of the submissions)
  * Did they start before the event?
  * Is it one big commit at the beginning of the event? (Remember, some hackers are new! And just don't know how to use Git. One commit at the end of the event is NOT a reason to DQ)
  * Does their readme mention a different event?
  * Is every team member contributing?
* Is a solo hacker making a really advanced project in a single weekend?
* Are their Timestamps over the weekend when they run the demo in any video/screen captures?
* (If they have a video) Was the video published over the weekend?
* (If they have a video) Does it mention another event? Does it mention yours?
* Look at the team members Devpost profiles - Have they submitted this project to any other hackathons? Does it look similar to an old project in their portfolio?

This list is not exhaustive, there are other checks you can do. These are some recommended things to look out for.

# Judges Communication and Recruiting

Typically during the last 2 months of the hackathon approaching, one should start looking out for judges for the hackathon. After making the judging plan, it becomes very clear on how many judges one should consider recruiting at the hackathon. While reaching out the judges, aim for getting 2-3 extra judges in a buffer list since any non-availability might affect your whole judging plan.

## Booking your Judges

You’ll need to recruit a variety of tech experts to judge, mentor & speak at your hackathon. Consider targeting:

* Experts from your school, including professors, deans, and alumni
* Local community leaders
* Reps from local tech companies
* Tech celebrities who have something to promote (best for bigger events)

Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges:

* It’s similar to the process of contacting sponsors.
* Consider who you know and who your school knows
* Have department heads reach out for you when helpful

## A Note About Judges

We recommend selecting judges that have a strong technical aptitude. It is important to mention to your judges about the judging criteria and not to focus on the business aspect of the hackathon. This highly separates a hackathon from a startup contest.

* Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges
  * It’s a similar sponsorship process
  * Consider who you know and who your school knows
  * Have department heads reach out for you

## Week-of: Judges follow up

It is crucial to follow-up with your judges about their availability on the week of the event to know if there are any last minute changes in the same. A simple reminder email can help you do the job.

Also, having some kind of a slot booking system can help you determine that they'll be available during those times. Be sure to send them a calendar invite so that it is tracked from their side as well.

## Day-of: Running Judging

Check out [Judging Plan](judging-plan.md) for the process for day of judging.  Some occasional follow-ups with them about the judging process is also a great way to keep a track of time as you follow the steps listed there.&#x20;

## Go Above and Beyond!

To make the judging process clear to both judges and hackers, we suggest printing out a brief summary of the rules and placing them at every presenting table alongside their table number.

## MLH Tips

* Start close to home. Often your best chances at hosting strong speakers will come from personal and school connections.
* Consider recruiting a high-energy MC. [This person will be the face of the event to hackers and sponsors, so having someone who is excited about hacking with some public speaking experience helps hold the entire event together.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

# Judging Plan

Judging has always been the biggest pain point for every hackathon organizer. This is due to the fact that while planning out the event, other than recruiting and finalizing the judges, and assigning a certain time for judging, organizing teams do not plan anything further, assuming everything can be managed on the day-of. But, in reality, if planned right, judging can be one of the easiest and smoothest aspects of any hackathon.

Our strong recommendation is implementing a science-fair type of judging plan. We also recommend holding your judging **in person** to ensure less chaos on your end while guaranteeing a meaningful presentation experience to your attendees.

Structurally, we recommend having hackers submit 2 minute videos on your submission platform for the judges to review. Make sure they put a lot of love and care into their submission. Their video should be a demo of their hack, not a presentation. This is not needed for judging when science fair style, but can be a reference during final deliberations, and is always a good future reference if they want to include it on their resumes.&#x20;

To avoid confusion, the key is to **make sure hackers know exactly where you are in the schedule for judging.** Tell them you’re advancing to the next stage of judging when you do, or if judging is taking longer than expected, tell them how far along you are. Giving quick updates like “Our judges have reviewed about 50% of the projects!” goes a long way in keeping hackers engaged.

### Shortlisting/elimination rounds.&#x20;

We have decided not to work with hackathons with elimination rounds before projects are due, resulting in hackers having to leave the venue earlier than expected. We recommend having one pre-event shortlisting round online instead. All hackers should make it to the first judging round after submissions are due. Many events only have one judging round, though some may pick finalists to show off during closing ceremony. Keep in mind you will need \~7 minutes per team if you do this, 3-5 for the presentation and 2 minutes to set up the next group.&#x20;

## 1. Set Up Science Fair Style Judging

In this particular judging style, assume your hackathon to be a science fair and every hacker team setting up their stall at assigned table numbers. Hackers present their hackathon project in front of the judges one by one as they arrive at their stalls, and judges score them accordingly. This way every hackathon attendee is getting a chance to demo in front of the judges and have the experience of presenting at the hackathon. Judges can also ask questions if they need clarifications on any part of the project.&#x20;

For this method you need to assign table numbers. Before the event, make a map of the room with numbers so that judges can easily see where to go once assigned projects. Also at each table have a piece of paper with the project number. Make sure teams know to keep this visible. For optional added visibility, you can add the number to a stick(think kite dowel about a yard long that you can get at places like Home Depot) that makes the number visible over the top of hacker's heads.&#x20;

### Why not Judging Rooms?

MLH does not recommend having teams come to judges in a room. Those format types frequently have a hard time being fair because teams are only judged against the projects that happened to have the same room. Even if you have a final deliberation discussion to compare rooms, since only 1 room saw a team, ever single finalist project has to be re-pitched which relies on judge memory and notes. It is also hard to followup with team who may need to be asked questions - like asking them to share their code that they forgot to add to Devpost or to ask followup questions based on what your team finds during a cheating check.&#x20;

### What about Gavel/Gavel 2.0/Jury/Building your own system?

While these methods can be functional, your team needs to be very familiar with the process. Make sure the team does test runs before the event with your other organizers as fake judges. Also that your team can export the data at any point in time/has backups in case they system crashes so you do not lose all judging progress. Use last year's Devpost data to test it. Reach out to league@mlh.io if you need help getting an example export.&#x20;

We recommend events use stack ranking (detailed below) as it is easier for organizers who have not handled judging before. It is also harder to break a google spreadsheet than a custom platform.&#x20;

## 2. Timing and Assigning Judges

### Time Requirement

Towards the end of the hackathon, take out some buffer time for the judging. This usually takes around 2 - 3 hours, depending on the number of submissions and judges.

### Calculating the required number of Judges

A typical calculation for the number of judges looks like follows:

$$J = ⌈(P * n * t )/ T⌉$$

Where,\
$$J =$$ Number of Judges\
$$P =$$ Number of Submitted Projects\
$$n =$$ Number of Judges for each project (or number of rounds of judging per project)\
(MLH recommendation: 3 rounds per project)\
$$t =$$ Time taken by a Judge per project (MLH recommendation: 3 mins per project)\
$$T =$$ Total time allocated for Judging (in minutes)

For eg.: Consider you have **150 projects submitted** at your hackathon and you have **allocated 2 hours for judging**. As per our recommendation, we are having **3 rounds of judging** per project and **3 minutes are allocated per project** for a judge to take their decision.

Now the calculation looks like:

J= (150\*3\*3)/120 = 11.25 = 12

Hence the number of **judges required is 12**. Look at our[ judge communication and recruiting page](judges-communication-and-recruiting.md) to get enough judges for your event!

### A go to table to estimate the number of judges required:

|                                       | **Number of attendees** |        |        |        |         |         |         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | :----: | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Time Allocated for Judging (mins)** |                         | **45** | **60** | **90** | **120** | **150** | **180** |
|                                       | **100**                 |    9   | 7      | 5      | 5       | 4       | 4       |
|                                       | **200**                 |   15   | 12     | 9      | 7       | 6       | 5       |
|                                       | **300**                 |   22   | 17     | 12     | 10      | 8       | 7       |
|                                       | **400**                 |   29   | 22     | 15     | 12      | 10      | 9       |
|                                       | **500**                 |   35   | 27     | 19     | 15      | 12      | 10      |
|                                       | **600**                 |   42   | 32     | 22     | 17      | 14      | 12      |
|                                       | **700**                 |   49   | 37     | 25     | 20      | 16      | 14      |
|                                       | **800**                 |   55   | 42     | 29     | 22      | 18      | 15      |
|                                       | **900**                 |   62   | 47     | 32     | 25      | 20      | 17      |
|                                       | **1000**                |   69   | 52     | 35     | 27      | 22      | 19      |
|                                       | **1100**                |   75   | 57     | 39     | 30      | 24      | 20      |
|                                       | **1200**                |   82   | 62     | 42     | 32      | 26      | 22      |

### Allocating Projects

Allocating projects for overall judging is more logistically heavy in a science fair style of judging because each judge cannot see every project. The goal is to have each project seen at least 3 times, but not have judges see the same "sets". For example, we do not want teams 1-10 only judged against teams 1-10, so we stagger the teams the judges see. Spacing out projects helps make it more fair for overall judging.&#x20;

For categories that have fewer submissions(like AI or Hardware challenges/tracks), you can instead have 1-2 subject matter experts who are familiar with the category view just those projects and pick the winner that best fits the category. Your subject matter expert for a hardware category might be the president of the IEEE club on campus or a teacher familiar with hardware. If you have a large category(like best design), use overall judging to narrow down top teams then see who among them best fit the criteria for the category.

Check out the Readme on our [Judging Example Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eyfZmUMA63oG_89l6n6zpHj_o5V2xwS-gyndmTl5Z24/edit#gid=1202683513) for allocating judges to projects! This example process makes sure each team is seen by at least 3 different judges.&#x20;

### Judging Debrief

Once you assign your judges projects you are ready to release them to start visiting teams! Before they head out into the crowd, remind them of these key points:

* **They only have 3 minutes per team**. You want the process to be fair, and have time to see every team enough times, so keep to a strict timeline.
* **Focus on learning over profit.** Sorry to break it to you, but 99% of hackers are going to hackathons to have fun and learn something. It is rare that anyone goes to a hackathon to bootstrap a startup (Startup Weekend/StartupBus are not hackathons), and rarely do those people win hackathons because they spent their time creating a product rather than awesome technology. Occasionally, cool hacks (like [Grooply](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2010/05/live-from-the-techcrunch-disrupt-hackathon-demos.html), which became GroupMe) become products over time but rarely do they start out that way. Hacks are built as creative solutions to problems or simply for fun, not to make money.
* **They need to bring back top 3 projects of the set assigned.** Once they do this, they will be assigned additional sets as needed.
* **If they need help, go to X location.** Your helpdesk, your judging room on the side, a space by the front stage. Have a designated space to go to for help or to flag project they think might be cheating.

## 3. Choosing Winners

There're plenty of options with finalizing winners, but at MLH, we love to use Stack Ranking because it normalizes scores across judges. Some judges are super nice, and might give higher scores overall than a stricter judge. By using stack ranking, you eliminate the point variation and make it so teams earn points based on how they rank with each judge instead of as an overall score that depends on what the judge considers a 5/8/10.

**Stack Ranking:** To run stacking ranking, you'll be needing to the following steps:

* Allocate projects to every judging according to what we discussed above.
* Ask each judge to view their projects and report back their top 3 best/favorite projects.
* Assign the top three following points:
  * 3 points (First Place)&#x20;
  * 2 points (Second Place)
  * 1 point (Third Place)

Now, you'll have a list of the project that appeared across multiple judges' top three favorites! After you've bubbled up your top projects, you should validate the results. Go check out the top 3-5 projects and make a final decision about winners. This is your hackathon. Make sure you're proud of the final results! Do a cheating check on all winners before you announce.&#x20;

# Rules for Your Hackathon

Check out our full recommended rule list at [https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/standard-hackathon-rules.md](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/standard-hackathon-rules.md)

Making your rules clear will help you keep your hackathon fair for all attendees, and easily be able to point to specific rules if you have to disqualify hackers for cheating.

We know that some hackathons vary though, so are including some specific rules your team should decide on.&#x20;

* How many people per team?
  * Can hackers participate solo?&#x20;
  * Can the teams be as large as they want, and you might just have only 4 prizes?
  * We see hackers have the most success with teams of a maximum size of 4
* Can they crosspost to other hackathons on the same weekend?
  * If there is a digital event in the same timeframe of your event can they submit to both?
  * We generally recommend no but you should very clearly state this
* Do they have to submit code?
  * Is there a specific format?
    * GitHub link, repl.it, Google drive link, etc?
* Can they use publicly available frameworks?
  * Do they need to list said frameworks in a readme?
  * What about LLM/ChatGPT/AI usage?
    * We generally recommend having a rule to credit any tools used/be clear on what they made vs what they are using by having a detailed readme. Clarify it should not be a reskin of an existing AI tool. While LLMs can be great tools, focusing on what was created/changed/built on during the weekend vs what was just used is how we recommend framing it. If they do not credit it, disqualify/report to [cheating@mlh.io](mailto:cheating@mlh.io)
* Can they make multiple projects?
  * Recommend No
* Can they submit to multiple challenges?
  * Recommend Yes
* Deadline for submissions / time they can work on their projects
  * Make it very clear they cannot work on their project before the event.&#x20;
* Will judging will be in person?
  * Will it be science fair style?
    * Recommended
  * Or will everyone demo to the larger group
    * Recommended only for very small events
* Who is allowed to participate
  * Students only?&#x20;
  * Age Range?
  * No mentors/volunteers/organizers
* Are there any categories that require hackers to be a specific demographic?
  * Example: Beginners track where at least half the team must have this be their first hackathon.&#x20;
  * Make sure to state how many of the team members must fit the category in your rules before the event.&#x20;



================================================
FILE: general-information/judging-and-submissions/hackathon-submission-portal/README.md
================================================
# Hackathon Submission Portal

Hackathon portals are one of the most important needs for any hackathon to get the projects submitted in the right way. Though one might think that these portals are just working as a form collecting data from the attendees to showcase the project, just using a simple form can be a big problem in terms of judging a hackathon.

Hackathon portals provide separate pages for judges to look over the different details of the project, providing hackers with a page where they can fill in details and publish their projects in front of the world! They allow hackers to show off their projects after the event, and show which projects won the different prizes at an event. Other than that, various tools and services these portals provide are a great way to enhance the overall hacking and organizing experience for everyone involved. They provide clear prize lists, can be utilized to help with judging, and more!

While there are a ton of different platforms to use for judging, Devpost is the most common at MLH Hackathons.

{% content-ref url="using-devpost.md" %}
[using-devpost.md](using-devpost.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="using-devfolio.md" %}
[using-devfolio.md](using-devfolio.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If your event chooses not to use Devpost (we recommend using Devpost as it is much easier than custom making a platform) you should have have the ability to create an export of projects that has the fields below. We also included an anonymized example Devpost export below. While some in the example are Devpost specific and just recommendations to help you, this list is the required fields to submit to MLH after your event.&#x20;

* Project Name
* Submission URL (so that project can be viewed post event)
* About the Project
* Try it out / GitHub Link
* Did you register a domain name this weekend? If so what was the domain?
* Opt-In Prizes (any categories/tracks they submitted to)
* Built With
* Share feedback about any technology you interacted with at this hackathon. Remember to mention what tech you're reviewing
* Schools of team members
* Team Member Information (separate columns for each field and each team member)
  * First
  * Last
  * Email
* Which of the following GenAI tools did you use this weekend? (Required Dropdown Multiselect)
  * OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Llama, IBM Watson, Gemini, Gemma, DeepSeek, I did not use GenAI, and Other
* Did you implement a generative AI model or API in your hack this weekend? (Required Long text)
  * Help Text: "If so, how and why did you use it? If not, mark your response as ‘N/A’"
* If you are submitting to the Best Use of Gemini API prize category, please provide your Gemini API Key Project Number. (Optional, Short text)
  * Help Text: "Head over to Gemini AI Studio > Click the 'Get API Key' button > Click the 'Project Number' for your API Key > Copy the 'Project Number' and submit below"

# Using Devfolio

Setting up your Devfolio hackathon page will help you manage registrations, check-ins, submissions, judging, and assigning winners. Please follow [this guide on Devfolio](https://guide.devfolio.co/organizers/set-up-your-first-hackathon-on-devfolio) for step by step instructions.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you ever have questions, you can reach out to the Devfolio team at [community@devfolio.co](mailto:community@devfolio.co).
{% endhint %}

If you decide to use Devfolio and are applying to be an MLH member event, please ensure the following:

1. Unlike Devpost, Devfolio has an approval process that your event needs to go through before you can start using their platform. Make sure to work ahead of time to be able to stick to your registration timeline.
2. Please confirm that submission requirements & [rules](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/rules-for-your-hackathon) for your event have been added correctly.&#x20;
3. Make sure you understand what [tracks and prizes](https://guide.devfolio.co/organizers/setup/prizes) mean on Devfolio. Once you become a Member Event, we’ll send you more information on the MLH partners that are active at your event.&#x20;
   * Add Major League Hacking as a track. You can find our logo [here](https://mlh.io/brand-guidelines).
   * Add the category prize, by MLH partners, as a new prize under the MLH track.
   * Leave the ‘Amount in USD’ blank unless one of our partners is giving out crypto as a prize.&#x20;
4. Add [league+devfolio@majorleaguehacking.com](mailto:league+devfolio@majorleaguehacking.com) (@MLHacks) as a manager/admin to your event’s Devfolio page. This allows us to ask Devfolio for help for step 6.&#x20;
5. As Devfolio doesn’t allow for custom submission questions, please make sure to ask hackers to add answers to these questions as part of their submissions -
   * Links or other information relevant to MLH category prizes they opt-in to. Example: domain name that the team redeemed if a domain partner was active at your event.
   * Share feedback about any technology you interacted with at this hackathon. Remember to mention what tech you're reviewing (e.g. MongoDB, GitHub, Auth0, etc.).&#x20;
6. Practice exporting data from Devfolio to make sure you are ready for the day of judging. Devfolio does not share all of the registration fields as part of the exported file. Please reach out to [community@devfolio.co](mailto:community@devfolio.co) to get the complete export with the [MLH required fields](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/managing-registrations/registration-timelines#important-registration-fields), or let your Hackathon Community Manager (HCM) know if you need help. We recommend adding a custom submission question for the following fields that aren’t included in the general export from Devfolio (as of June 2024) -
   * Phone number
   * Age
   * Level of Study
   * Country
   * [MLH Checkboxes](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/managing-registrations/registration-timelines#important-registration-fields)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you ever have questions or need help using Devpost you can reach out to the Devpost team at [support@devpost.com](mailto:support@devpost.com).
{% endhint %}

## Submissions

When you are editing your hackathon on Devpost the Submissions section allows you to set the start date and deadline of the submission period for your hackathon. You’ll also be able to add final reminders and custom submission questions for your hackers.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-16-at-11.50.09-am.png)

## Judging on Devpost

Devpost has two different judging options:

**Online judging** allows you to have judges sign up for Devpost accounts, login, and review projects based on the judging criteria you set.

**Offline judging** allows you to run judging however you want. This can be through expos, demos, presentations, or any combination of other judging methods. Once hackers submit, you can export the submission data to a CSV file which will allow you to use it for your judging process.

# Check-in Process

It's important to have a clear check-in process day-of so you know who is attending. This data is valuable for your team and stakeholders in your event. For your team, it gives you a clear demarcation of who actually attended the event and finally who submitted. These stats help you know what exactly has been the reach for your event. For the sponsors, this data is again highly beneficial to know how many people actually got to know about their offering vs how many utilized them.

If you have already gathered all the fields you need from attendees, there a ton of ways to gather check-ins. If you missed a data category like address or age at registration, you can use check-in as an opportunity to get that info.

### Check-in Time!

Check-ins for physical events are important to make sure you know who is at the venue. Having lanyards, wristbands, or nametags can help identify who is supposed to be at the venue, and also help put names to people who meet at the event.&#x20;

Organizers can have volunteers set up at table/s depending on the size. Make sure to have plenty of space for a line, and that it is spread out enough from sponsor tables that the area will not get congested with the initial flood of hackers.&#x20;

Have a way for the volunteers to verify the attendees have registered. A simple ctrl+f for the name in a google spreadsheet with a column to mark with an X is an easy way to set up check-in. Have assorted stickers/swag hackers can grab while volunteers are completing the check-in process. If your event requires school/state ID to verify identity this would be the time to check.&#x20;

If your hackers need to write down their name have a table or two with lots of sharpies on the side that they can go to after they check in. Some hackers may take a bit more time for this step (especially if their hands are full of stickers/swag) and you do not want to clutter up the check in lin.&#x20;

Consider having a separate form for late registrations, even if they have to wait until after all preregistered attendees have had time to check-in. Everyone checking in should still complete your full registration form.&#x20;

# Free Registration Tool - OrganizerHQ (OHQ)

Typeform or Google Forms costing you money due to your event size? Worried about hackers trying to steal your data if you build your own platform? Want quick setup of registrations so you can make your registration live quickly?

Some perks of OHQ:

* It is free!
* OHQ automatically has all the required MLH fields
  * This has the added benefit of being faster for hackers to register if they have an MLH account already
* You can add custom questions of your own
* You can also use the dashboard to see how marketing efforts are going
* You can export the data at any time
* Update the image and descriptions to point back to your website
* Use it for easy checkin &#x20;
* You can add anyone on your team so they can help you manage it

Reach out to league@mlh.io for help getting this set up for your event or if you have any further questions. You can also be added as a team member on the example event if you would like to test it out!

Let's see some screenshots

### Dashboard

Check in on how marketing is going! You can see spikes in registrations to see what is working best for marketing. You can also use it day of to keep track of how many attendees have checked in.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/dashboard.PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>An example from Globabl Hack Week Signups</p></figcaption></figure>

### Easy Export and Custom Question Functionality

You can see hackers who register, add new attendees manually (if you need to add someone new the day of your event at check-in for example), and utilize this page for Rejections and Checking in Hackers. You can export your registrations at any time using the Export button, which emails you a .csv of the hackers.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/registrations page.PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>See who has registered for your event on the registrations page</p></figcaption></figure>

If a hacker already has an account(from attending another event or participating in Global Hack Week), they only have to answer additional questions you can see in the question tab on this example event. You can see all the information for them when they register for your event. You can also add your own questions.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/custome questions.PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>These are the only questions an existing user would answer. You can add your own event specific questions up top!</p></figcaption></figure>

This next preview is of the example export. It will include all registrants in the same file, but for privacy reason we only included 1 example registration with mock data.&#x20;

# Registrations

Getting in registrations does not only make sure you have a participation pool to pass on updates for your event, rather, it is about the **community you're forming** around it. Every hacker that attends your hackathon becomes a member of your community and stays as one as long as you're interacting with them in the right way. For growing as a hackathon, you need to grow as a community which mean every individual needs to grow!

We recommend organizers to start some **pre-registration process** before they launch the main hackathon website. This helps capture the emails of interested hackers much before the main registrations start. Getting in just name and emails should be good enough for this particular process. We recommend having hackers create MyMLH accounts so organizers don't have to manually collect hackathon-relevant data such as school names and shipping addresses.

As the main registration process starts, it is vital to get in some demographic details of the attendees of your hackathon. Collecting data is useful for your team's ability to understand the demographics of your event. This can be typically beneficial while projecting your sponsors with your demographic charts and letting them know the impact your hackathon has had on the different sectors of the society. It is also extremely useful while going for targeted marketing for your event as you know the interested audience and their involvement with your hackathon. OHQ is a useful tool to set up your hackathon and easily manage registrations and check-ins that is compatible with MyMLH profiles. Reach out to your Hackathon Community Manager to hear more about using OHQ and MyMLH!

**Statistically about 50% of hackers that register for events show up.** They may make plans, decide not to attend last minute, or feel like there is no loss not coming to a free event they previously signed up for. Take this into account and aim for double the amount of registrations. Also make a plan for what to do if you have more sign ups than your event is being planned for. Do not go over double of your aimed attendance. If you exceed your initial goals you might need to make a waitlist. Try to give priority to hackers who are closer to your event since they are more likely to actually show up.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Registrations vs Check-Ins over 323 Events.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Stats from 323 events we have worked with to show the 50% trendline.</p></figcaption></figure>

**Please note:** As with all personal data, use the utmost care to keep participant data safe. We recommend hackathons to use the personal data just for the day of communication and not share it with anyone until you get specific permission from your hackers to do so.

You can see our example Registration form [here](https://majorleaguehacking.typeform.com/example-mlh-reg)

## Important Registration Fields

**These are required to be&#x20;**_**in the format detailed below**_**&#x20;for MLH Member Events**

* **First Name**
  * It is important to collect the first and last name fields separately. Some people go by multiple first names/last names (example: "Maria Anne De La Cruz").
* **Last Name**
* **Age**
  * We recommend this as a dropdown with specific ages instead of date of births. MLH needs this data for eligibility purposes (some codes are only available to hackers 18+). **We do not collect dates of birth as part of event registration to reduce data risk**.
* **Phone Number**
  * In case you need to call someone during the event. This may also be needed if you have to send a message to all participants for some reason (for example weather related emergency notification).
* **Email**
  * So you can communicate before and after the event. Location, schedule, feedback, etc.&#x20;
* **School** (use [MLH's list of verified schools](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/master/schools.csv))
  * Use a set list instead of having students type out their school. This will result in uniform results. If you see one that hasn't been included, please add it via [my.mlh.io](https://my.mlh.io/signin) and we'll verify it soon.
    * For example some universities can have multiple versions of the name. Each will show as a different option, and will skew your demographic data showing how many students came from each school.&#x20;
      * **The** University of Texas at Dallas
      * University of Texas at Dallas
      * UTD
      * UTDallas
* **Level of Study -** instead of or in addition to Graduation Year
  * Less than Secondary / High School
  * Secondary / High School
  * Undergraduate University (2 year - community college or similar)
  * Undergraduate University (3+ year)
  * Graduate University (Masters, Professional, Doctoral, etc)
  * Code School / Bootcamp
  * Other Vocational / Trade Program or Apprenticeship
  * Post Doctorate
  * Other&#x20;
  * I’m not currently a student&#x20;
  * Prefer not to answer
* **Country of Residence**
  * [**We heavily recommend using the ISO 3166 Standard for Country names.**](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  * **We recommend this as a dropdown.** It’s okay to put your hackathon’s country at the top for ease of use.
  * Again be careful not to have users type input, or you will get a million answers for the same countries.&#x20;
    * US
    * USA
    * United States
    * Unites States of America
* **LinkedIn URLs**
  * Ask hackers to provide their LinkedIn URL to be able to connect with partners post-event for potential job opportunities.&#x20;

## MLH Checkboxes

MLH Member Events also are required to have 3 checkboxes. 2 of them hackers MUST agree to. The 3rd is optional (they can agree or disagree), **but we require it to be in your registration form**.&#x20;

**Please add the following disclaimer and 3 checkboxes** if you plan to work with us. You can remove the disclaimer once you have moved into our official Membership Stage(Talk with your HCM if you have questions).&#x20;



"We are currently in the process of partnering with MLH. The following 3 checkboxes are for this partnership. If we do not end up partnering with MLH, your information will not be shared"

# Sending Reminders

Follow-ups and reminders can be different for your hackathon. These all depend on the registration, pre registration and other significant events within your hackathon. Please keep in mind not to spam your attendees because that affects your hackathons' experience significantly.

The first follow-up we recommend is for the hackers who have done the pre registration for your hackathon, informing them to register for the hackathon after the main registrations are up. We recommend sending out just 1 or a maximum of 2 follow-ups, which should be also cross referenced from your current registered hackers' list and sent to those who have not registered.

The other follow-up is for the last years' attendees informing them about the new iteration of your hackathon and asking them to register for it. The follow-ups here should be similar to what you do for the pre registered hackers, first one done while rolling out the registrations and the second one during the last month to the hackathon.

For the registered participants, the follow-up looks a bit different. To keep them excited we recommend informing them about the major happenings within your hackathon, but again that email should also be confined to a maximum of 1 where you can also ask them to stay in touch by joining the social handles of the event.

Finally, a week before your hackathon, it is the perfect time to remind everyone involved about what needs to happen at the event. Be sure to reach out to the different people involved according to their role at the event:

* **Attendees:** Send clear instructions about when and where to check-in.
* **Sponsors:** Sponsors also need clear instructions about when and where to check-in.&#x20;
* **Volunteers and Fellow Organizers:** Confirm all volunteer sign-up and designated duties. Send clear instructions about when and where to report.
* **Judges and Speakers:** Check-in times and overview of what they should expect day-of.&#x20;

# Marketing Goals & Timelines

Before setting any timelines, you have to set up goals of targeting your hackers. These can be limited to your university, city, state, country or a certain region. **We recommend focusing on your local community first and then expanding from there.** This makes sure that your roots are strong and you're ready to expand with your hackathon!

As you plan your marketing timeline, keep in mind that you will see a drop-off rate between the number of hackers who signed up to attend your event and the number who participate. The attrition rate varies from event to event, but in general, we expect about a **50% drop-off rate** for free hackathons.

In general, we recommend aiming to have 100% of your goal attendance signed up two weeks before the event and 200% of your attendance goal signed up one week in advance. We also recommend having an upper limit to the number of registrations you can expect. Having some kind of a filtering process for attendees helps a lot in ensuring the quality and interest in participation.

For example, if you're aiming to have 500 attendees, a good timeline may be:

| Timeline            | Registration Numbers |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **3 months before** | Registrations Open!  |
| **2 months before** | 100 Signups          |
| **1 month before**  | 250 Signups          |
| **2 weeks before**  | 600 Signups          |
| **1 week before**   | 1000 Signups         |

_Keep in mind that MLH requires registration 1 week before the event for events we partner with so we can prep the pre-event email and complete a check for bad actors. Ask your HCM if you have any questions!_

# Promoting your Event

When promoting your hackathon, it’s useful to keep in mind that most events have a 30-50% drop-off in attendance. Given these stats, it’s your goal to over-market and overbook!

Marketing your hackathon is another one of the major areas of focus one has while planning it out. The aim here is to reach as many people as possible with the focus on the right audience meant for the event. But before that, it is necessary to evaluate your target community and region as the focus of marketing. You can have a hackathon in your local community, city and extend it to your state, country and even abroad. Written below are certain strategies that might help you promote your event.

## Tell Your Hackathon’s Story

What’s your hackathon’s "brand?" How is it unique? Why would _you_ want to attend?

* The more tailored your message, the better. Make it school-specific.
* Use the same messaging to stay consistent and build momentum
* Highlight hackathon benefits perks and the ease of attending: it’s free of cost, transportation will be provided, etc.

In summary: include date, location, website URL, and key points like workshops, prizes, food, and swag!

## Hackathon Marketing Strategies

* **Post Flyers!**
  * Follow your schools rules but post them everywhere you can. People underestimate how much flyers can help advertise their event. Flyers are usually ignored the first few times people see them, so more flyers means you are more likely to get people to actually read it.
* **Speak in-person during the first 5 minutes of relevant classes and student group meetings on your campus.**
  * Explain what it is, why they should care, when and where it’s being held, and how they can get more info.
* **Reach out to student groups and departments on all campuses**
  * Groups: ACM & IEEE, SWE, SHPE, etc.
  * Departments: Computer Science, Design, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Business Studies&#x20;
    * Professors and Resource Hubs on campus may be willing to share things out to their students. Some may even offer extra credit to their students for attending your event!
  * Think of other clubs or departments that may hold students interested in the other side of hacking (i.e. project management, design, UX, etc) such as entrepreneurship, communication, graphic design, and many more!
  * You can also get more from these groups to attend if you invite the clubs to run a workshop or volunteer. You can get subject matter experts hosting the workshops so you can focus on the logistics of running your event day of! As a bonus, they will market their workshop as part of your event!
* **Invite students from other schools to attend**
  * Look at schools that have previously hosted MLH hackathons
  * Look at other schools in your area/region. We suggest at least 3 schools within 6 hours of your campus
  * Don’t overlook community colleges — they’re often full of eager and  promising participants
* **Set up a table in the main area of your building for a few hours(with school permission)**
  * Show sneak peeks of swag, explain what a hackathon is to those who are not familiar, hand out the website url or a QR code to those who stop by on quarter page flyers or business cards.&#x20;
* **Launch a Social Media campaign**
  * Make a TikTok, Facebook Page, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit & LinkedIn account.
    * Consider having targeted Facebook or Instagram Ads. These are cheap and effective!
  * Invite and connect to all your friends and members of on and off-campus hacker groups. Check out the [Hackathon Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers) as an example.
  * Ask other hackathons to tweet or post about you.&#x20;
  * Reach out different community members to partner with your hackathon! The go to examples for these can be your local [GitHub Campus Experts](https://githubcampus.expert/), [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/), [Google Developer Groups](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg), [Facebook Developer Circles](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/), etc.
* **Get some pre-event press coverage**
  * Tell your school’s paper
  * Reach out to your local media outlets
  * Try reaching out to different startup/ media agencies for potential partnership.

# Getting support from others

## Working with Organizations

Organizations can be helpful for gaining access to free resources and support. Most often they are helpful for providing workshops, mentors, judges, volunteers, and even in-kind donations like venue space or laptops.

The difference between collaborating with organizations and your event sponsors is the exchange of money for services. Organizations that support your event are providing resources to your team for free with no strings attached.

For example, let’s say your team wants to give hackers access to a 3D printer at their hackathon. Your team could reach out to a local maker space to see if they would be willing to lend a printer and host an introductory 3D printing workshop.

### Outreach Strategies

The most effective way to get the support of an organization is to be specific with your ask and initial email. Below is an example for you to use a template!

> _Hello Imaginary Maker Space team! HighSchoolHacks is a 2-day hackathon for high school students in the Boston community. We have a hardware track to help high schoolers learn about the awesome projects you can make with both hardware and software._
>
> _Specifically, we wanted to teach them how to use a 3D printer in their hackathon project. I know your Maker Space has several printers, would you be interested in lending a printer for 2 hours on Saturday and/or hosting an introductory 3D printing workshop on Saturday, June 20th?_

Use a staff member's email or phone number over the organization’s central email address to maximize your chances of getting a response.

### **Building Relationships**

If you want to work with the organization next year, it’s important that you thank them after the event and provide them support in return when the opportunity arises. Too often hackathon teams are so focused on hitting their goals that they forget to thank and support the people that helped them along the way.

An organization is going to be much more inclined to help you again next year if you support their events or initiatives in return.

# Keeping Records

If you’re planning to host your hackathon again next year, taking detailed records during and after the planning process can help your team avoid common mistakes, and improve the experience for next year’s organizers and hackers.

For example, if you went over budget because snacks for hackers cost more than you expected then you should note that for next year’s team to help them avoid making the same mistake.

### Documentation

We recommend keeping all your documents in a central Google Drive folder, so future organizers can easily reference old resources as needed. If you have a central email for your hackathon like info@hackathon.org use it to create the Google Drive folder, so you don’t have to worry about transferring folder ownership year after year.

### Email Records

It’s incredibly valuable to keep email records with mentors, sponsors, and any stakeholders supporting your event. For example, you can use past sponsorship email correspondences to strengthen your sponsorship outreach strategy.

> Hey Company! Based on our correspondence last year, your team was interested in sponsoring at our event but the timing didn’t work out. Would you be interested in chatting again for this year’s event?

To keep all of your email records in one place, I recommend CC’ing a central email for your hackathon like info@hackathons.org on all of your emails. All of the emails will end up in one inbox for future teams to easily reference!

**Below are some tips to help you get started with recording keeping!**

* [ ] Schedule a 1-hour event reflection with your team a few days after the event to talk about what went well and what could have been improved. Review this document with next year’s organizing team, so you can answer any of their questions and provide them with any additional context. Below are some questions to get your discussion started.&#x20;
  * What were the main themes of the hacker feedback we received? Based on this feedback, what actions can be taken to improve their experience next year?&#x20;
  * What were the three biggest challenges we can into while planning the event? What can we do to overcome these challenges next year?&#x20;
  * What three resources were the most helpful? How can we help next year’s team better leverage these resources?&#x20;
*   [ ] Create a document for your team to dump feedback and challenges during the event and event planning process, so you don’t forget them. After the event, you can organize the document and either directly share it with next year’s team or use it as a reference for your reflection call mentioned above.

# Host Exciting Mini-Events

Some examples of mini-events at events we have partnered with. They vary in cost, and some are easier than others to host. Ask clubs on campus if they can help out to keep costs low!

* Cookie decorating
* Scavenger Hunt
* Smash Tournament
* Paper Airplane Competition
* Tetris Tournament- tetr.io
* Jackbox Games-Make sure you are in family friendly mode
* Life Size Hungry Hungry Hippos- do you remember the little scooters from elementary school?
* RV race (for a bonus add geese on top)
* Smores- only if you have a firepit nearby on campus already available
* Ice Skating on a nearby frozen canal
* Watch the sunset/sunrise if you have a tall venue
* Lego break
* Dog visits
* Yoga
* Giant Chess
* Board Game break area
* Life Size Pacman

# Cup Stacking

## What is Cup Stacking?

Cup Stacking is a historic hackathon mini-event that lets hackers take a break from coding and screen time to engage in a silly activity with their friends and fellow hackers. In teams of up to four, participants attempt to create the tallest tower of cups stacked on each other.

Cup Stacking is typically run as a tournament bracket, with winning teams from each round moving on to the next. However, Cup Stacking is flexible. Hackers can spend hours figuring out the optimal method as a group rather than competing. Feel free to tweak the guidelines below to fit your venue and needs.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/cupstacking.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Materials

* You will need 100 cups per team to run this game. We recommend having 400 cups on hand.
* You'll need a watch or phone to set a timer to keep each round the same length.&#x20;
* Make sure your venue has space for this. Teams need about five square feet of space to stack, and you'll likely have a crowd watching, too. Make sure your ceilings won't restrict the total height either!
* Optionally, a megaphone or microphone can help call teams when it is their turn.&#x20;

## Procedures

1. Open up a spreadsheet, doc, or note. You'll be recording team names.&#x20;
2.  As hackers come to the event, encourage them to find a team of 4 hackers and then come to you with a team name.

    _Protip: If folks are struggling to form teams of 4. Have them hold up their hands with the number of hackers they currently have. They should look for another group with a corresponding number of hackers._&#x20;
3. While hackers make teams, set out four stacks of 100 cups each where teams will play.
4. Once you have a suitable number of teams or are ready to start, explain the rules. See the [#rules-checklist](cup-stacking.md#rules-checklist "mention") below for a great spiel to give to your hackers.&#x20;
5. We recommend running cup stacking in short rounds. Call out your first four team names from your list and assign them to one of the stacks of cups.
6. Once hackers are in position, please give them a countdown and start the clock!&#x20;
7. We recommend moving around through the space during the stacking and chatting with groups. Work the crowd and get folks excited and engaged.&#x20;
8. As the round nears its end, start a countdown from ten.&#x20;
9. Count each stack and announce the winning team. Remember to record them in your doc, sheet, or note.&#x20;
10. It helps the event run more smoothly if the teams restack their cups into two neat piles after competing.&#x20;
11. Repeat as needed until you have an overall winner!

## Rules Checklist

The rules of cup stacking are exceedingly simple. It's your hackers and the cups. Chances are, if folks ask a question, they're trying to cheat! /s&#x20;

* No chairs/tables/other furniture to stand on. You can use your partners' backs for more height if they let you!
* Once time is called, participants must put their hands straight up in the air! No cheating!
* The cup tower must stand during the whole counting period.

Want to up the difficulty? Put 4 strings on a rubber band. The only way they can add cups to the tower is to use that rubber band (see pic).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/7C0A8019 (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Raise the difficulty by using a rubber band and 4 strings as the only way to add to the tower. </p></figcaption></figure>

## Tie Break Rules

While ties don't happen that often, they do occur. We recommend one of two silly solutions;

* Jenga rules. Teams must remove one cup at a time each from somewhere on their tower without reducing the overall height.&#x20;
* Add a cup. Teams must add a cup (making their total height one taller, no side towers!) without their tower crumbling down.&#x20;

# Bob Ross

MS Paint Bob Ross is MLH's new favourite mini-event and hopefully yours too. You’ll be watching a Bob Ross video alongside hackers and creating a masterpiece.

## **Pro Tips**

* You should paint something alongside the hackers and Bob Ross. You get to participate too.
* Regularly check in with folks and schmooze a bit. This should be a silly interactive stream.
* Make sure hackers know they’re going to post their creations at the end.

## **Setup**

* Make sure you’re logged into the appropriate Zoom account
* Head to [https://www.twitch.tv/bobross/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/bobross/videos)
* Open up [https://jspaint.app/](https://jspaint.app/)
* Find a video to use for your event. Your choice!

## **Running the Event**

* Share the video you selected with hackers and ask them to queue up the video. 
* Have hackers open up [https://jspaint.app/](https://jspaint.app/) or the paint application of their choice. 
* Share your screen so hackers can see you painting if they’d like to.
* Do a countdown for the video and have everyone follow along together. 
* At the end, have hackers take turns sharing their screens to showcase their work or consider posting them in a public channel of some sort!

# Hacker Hangouts

Hacker Hangouts are a great way to meet other people and mingle. It’s hard to bump into someone and spark a conversation digitally, so we created this event to foster those moments of social interaction!

## **You will need:**

* Access to Zoom and breakout rooms
* Appointed captains for the breakouts
* A list of questions

You will break hackers up into groups of three. As soon as you get three hackers, have someone volunteer to be a captain, or pick someone, and then break them off. Keep repeating until you are out of friendos.

Three is the sweet spot because it’s small enough to make sure everyone participates, but not as intimidating as one on one. Also, your questions will say five or ten minutes, but those are mostly suggestions.

## **Share these rules with hackers:**

1. Avoid talking about Coronavirus or related topics. Not only is much of our day to day involving it, it’s important to have a space that doesn’t include it in any way, shape, or form.&#x20;
2. Each group will be assigned a captain. The leader’s main responsibility is to make sure everybody in the group participates.
3. Once the new topic is given, you must move on. If you find yourself not wanting to move on, that’s great but you still gotta go to the next talking point. Talk to them about it afterwards!
4. Be respectful of others. Give them time to talk and share their opinions, thoughts, etc. It’s essential to give everyone a safe space so that everyone feels encouraged to participate.&#x20;

## **Pro tips for making questions if you need to:**

* Start off light, and end on a positive note. The middle question can be deeper and more introspective, but we want open participation**,** so avoid sensitive topics.
* Also, avoid questions with discrete answers. Instead of asking, “what’s your favorite movie,” try to ask people to tell you stories about times they went to a movie theatre
  * You can always do an, “and why?” if you want to run a “favorite” question.
* Try to be on brand with the event you’re at! For example, Hack Girl Summer’s questions should have a different overall theme than Hack the Chain’s

## Some questions to get you headstarted:

* What are the books/movies/games/videos that never get old and always make your day a little brighter?
* What platitude do you think is bullshit? What platitude do you think holds truth? (Think, "love conquers all," or "when life gives you lemons...")
* Assume you have a lot of musical talent. If you started a band, how many people would be in it and which position would you be? What would you name it? What genre would you play?
* If there was a biopic about you, who would star in the movie of your life?
* What’s one common misconception about you? What’s one assumption about you that’s typically right?
* What was the best year of your life?
* What was your favourite thing or memory about the place you grew up?
* What have you been meaning to do but haven't yet done? Why haven't you done it?&#x20;
* What is something you’ve done/felt/seen/experienced that you wish you could do again for the first time?
* What is a perfect day for you?
* Tell us about a good friend, and either a memory you have with that person or something you admire about them.
* In the movie \*Inside Out\*, each person has a set of "core memories" that define who they are and how they behave. What's one of yours?

# Marble Races

## You will need:

* A Windows machine (Check the store page for marbles for minimum specs)
* Streamyard
* A microphone and commanding voice

## What is this?

Marbles on Steam is a free game where viewers of a twitch stream can hop in and put their name on a marble. The marbles race through a track with no input from the players. It’s very silly and not skill-based at all.

* Install Steam, if you don’t have a Steam account.
* Download Marbles on Stream.
* Log in to your Twitch account on Marbles.
* Click on the Race button to start a race. Once there, simply select “Random” to have it pick a random track.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TqhwtQe2fRC2v7NaGMmMdxR7VNq72SnDt7jOO2HQ5kODYjf1JA\_Cb5Wq9mdNzKZHBdBTZ57dqtCGFD6BTdf8ME3vzdohVRGPPCJWPgit8mG8XNGyMoLjwFSOkv7g-eDMZvnZ6TJG)

* Boot up Streamlyard and stream the game through it
* Once the map loads, tell the folks in the chat to type “!join” to join the race as a marble. No other commands work, and they don’t have any input on the game.
* Important: Stream delay is pretty large. Expect at worst 100 seconds between what you say and it appearing on stream.
* Begin the race once a significant portion of your viewers have joined. Control the camera using the WASD keys, and use Left Alt to display all the names of your marbles. Follow them around the track and provide fun commentary!
* Run the game 3 or so times, and whenever you decide to wrap up, hype up your final race by saying it’s the grand finals for marbles at your hackathon. If you can, award them a fun title for their victory in the Discord Channel!

# Pokemon Showdown

## **You will need:**

* A [Challonge](http://challonge.com) account

## **What is this?**

Pokemon Showdown is a way to play pokemon with others for free. We’re playing a format called Gen 8 Random Battles, which is where you’re given a random team of pokemon to fight with. It makes it much more random and silly, so this way almost everyone has a relatively fair shot at winning.

* About an hour before your mini-event, tell your hackers to create an account at [https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) if they’d like to participate.
* Create a google form for your event that asks hackers to write down their discord name and their Pokemon Showdown name. Make sure to link it up to a spreadsheet so you have easy access to the list of members.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UxwroPMACzmCyxmJiNGUrTBYc\_lLVIsP3wS3M-GF2aKLoho7wZNJITiHuoFpOtP4\_25IzA2MOUW99CdLN3dYSVhIPfLzuPoXgKZ7ks823YZVlU2F4l9Jzwt7Yst3krXjo3WlO5ux)

* Make an account over at [challonge.com](https://challonge.com/) and make a tournament bracket for your event. It should be single elimination -- other than that all the other default settings are fine. You can see a sample bracket [here](https://challonge.com/hacklariousPS).
* Once you have the bracket setup, begin collecting signups from your hackers. Cut it off 5 minutes before the tournament start time.
* Add your participants by navigating to the “participants” tab. From there click the “Bulk add participants” option to easily copy and paste your winners in from the sheet for your form.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fg0-m8Hg8Jni3XaUHtmBgJV8\_YU1s3s2H2F3nrKlMjYj9zw\_Tnimzv1cGkhcRRwsOWqWqSawaL3JZvB0msXywQ1P4UkWUCuvUUx7egLmig4r7TOAdrjl1R736OkGACa9CtaUw3sZ)

From there, you can start your bracket. You’ll be given a live link to your bracket that participants can navigate to. Have them reach out to their opponents and begin fighting in pokemon showdown in Gen 8 Random Battles.

\*\*\*\*

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HnnghOngq-Drv591S1vhuH1zsIT4XugYhylxFH0rzziPvVFX-OidFwM70j1iDoQdDRy8rSEPK980ON\_4KXZc3\_Y4\_YqzhkNUwHHgIKEWaSQ4ha4d4X9\_IFZ2O1OjYxULFvTwUV1S)

* Give your hackers 15 minutes to begin their round 1 match. Non responders get Disqualified. Ask participants to report the results of their matches.
* Proceed down the bracket. Round 1 will have the most troubleshooting -- after that, it’s usually much calmer.
* For your grand finals match, ask your participants to post a link to watch the fight. Repost that link in your hackathon’s announcements with some hype around it, saying it’s the grand finals for the prestigious pokemon tournament!
* Award the winner the Pokemon Master role which you can easily make on Discord.&#x20;

# Wiki Races

## **You will need:**

* Access to Zoom/ Video streaming service
* Any web browser
* Code of Conduct appropriate articles to search for and SFW adjacent articles

## **Wikipedia Races:**

The objective of this game is to try to get to a target **W**ikipedia article as quickly as possible using only links from your starting article and without any searches. To start, the Coach or MLHer staffing the mini event will announce the “finish line”.

For example, let’s say Kevin announces the target article is “Texas Hold ‘Em.” After that, all participants will go to their Wikipedia homepage, and click on the “Random article” link on the left hand side and the races will begin!

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4rDBkTwe\_s8VmrNeTUAy44kZiiSaFzHhOxIKBII0\_nBV2sNXUK0dfjVNi36beevkguISz-43FdFpn7tzx3xYWx-WkYaow-qfR495iHBVPS6s3kYA-AkrBevQObqhYHlqAkHxSlVc)

At which point, you’ll get your starting article:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MR4G2ZQegF2MUKzo7GEr\_PH6GH6xFyD5TwksebCmQEYbAbdFKrYBv0iP0jVBKi6R0npi26FS2aoMNHiexSM2uQqCxwmUrNFjkizJUlWPzS9R8L0Xfr0CfeS0Nh5pl-qHY4fjI1jd)

And after many control f’s and several clicks, we got to the endpoint!

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8CwnLhQyKENbDDYY4wdAjMZgGB7F7N7NnuOr-r-soMnvB2TQgLOFKsFi6k\_tySiWqJytWq4mvefus5QUzgCno\_fmR6UteY51OZ-WD6xhukx3eOSV8yg3gRo6FPEaDTX0Y\_7OZlH4)

Feel free to repeat the races as many times as time permits, as long as hackers are engaged and having fun.



## **Setup**

* Access to the MLH Zoom (see Coach cheat sheet)
* Access any web browser
* Code of Conduct appropriate articles to search for and SFW adjacent articles

## **Running the mini event**

* Choose a starting and ending article on Wikipedia
* Let attendees try to navigate their way from the start page to the end page in \~5 minutes.&#x20;
* Once a path has been found, ask them to go back into their search history and share with others how they got there.

## **Pro tips:**

* Countries are a very easy first race
* Narrow down to make it harder, such as a celebrity
* If hackers finish at the same time, use # of clicks to clinch tiebreakers

# MS Paint Bob Ross

MS Paint Bob Ross is MLH's new favourite mini-event and hopefully yours too. You’ll be watching a Bob Ross video alongside hackers and creating a masterpiece.

## **Pro Tips**

* You should paint something alongside the hackers and Bob Ross. You get to participate too.
* Regularly check in with folks and schmooze a bit. This should be a silly interactive stream.
* Make sure hackers know they’re going to post their creations at the end.

## **Setup**

* Make sure you’re logged into the appropriate Zoom account
* Head to [https://www.twitch.tv/bobross/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/bobross/videos)
* Open up [https://jspaint.app/](https://jspaint.app/)
* Find a video to use for your event. Your choice!

## **Running the Event**

* Share the video you selected with hackers and ask them to queue up the video. 
* Have hackers open up [https://jspaint.app/](https://jspaint.app/) or the paint application of their choice. 
* Share your screen so hackers can see you painting if they’d like to.
* Do a countdown for the video and have everyone follow along together. 
* At the end, have hackers take turns sharing their screens to showcase their work or consider posting them in a public channel of some sort!

# !Light

This is a frontend coding competition we borrowed without asking and renamed it '!Light', exactly the same as Code in the Dark.

* Each round lasts 10 minutes, and is between 5 to 10 participants
* All participants in each round are given the same screenshot of a website (e.g: Pinterest.com) and must recreate it to the best of their ability in HTML & CSS
* No code completion tools, no syntax highlighting, no compiling your code before 10 minutes
* Direct participants go to [http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENT](http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENT)
* The winner will be chosen by audience applause (so bring your friends!)
* Add .zip to the link above to review submissions

### **How do you Run !Light?**

1. **Share the editor.** Instruct participants to navigate to the !LIGHT editor on their computers. For this, you'll have them go to: [http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENTNAME](http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENTNAME). Bring your computer to this same URL to demonstrate.
2. **Explain the rules.** Explain to attendees that, _"You will remain in the text editor for the whole activity- you should not leave the page for anything. The text editor provided doesn't have syntax highlighting, code completion, or code preview. Your goal is to create a copy of the website I pull up on my screen in ten minutes."_
3. **Display the website.** Load the website the attendees will be copying. The best websites are ones with few images. We recommend the following, but often instructor and department websites work well:
   1. [http://google.com](http://google.com/)
   2. [http://news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com/)
   3. [http://mlh.io/beta/events](http://mlh.io/beta/events)
4. **Start coding.** Tell the attendees to begin and start your ten minute timer. You may want to play music during this time to keep the excitement level up. You should walk around the room and ensure everyone is staying in the code editor. Periodically announce how much time is remaining.
5. **End coding.** Once your timer finishes, tell everyone to stop coding. The participants should then mouseover and click "!LIGHT" at the top left side of their screen. They'll be presented with a dialog box asking if they're sure they want to submit. Have them select "Yes."
6. **Download and display submissions.** You can now download the submissions by navigating to [http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENTNAME.zip](http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENTNAME.zip). Unzip and open the folder on your machine. One-by-one, open the submissions.
7. **Vote.** Have attendees vote on their favorite submission- this is usually best achieved through voting by applause. You should break any ties.

You’re welcome to re-run the game with different websites as many times as your attendees want. <br>

# Slideshow Karaoke

An improv activity where the presenter is given a randomly selected presentation. The presentation can either be a real slideshow \(from [slideserve.com](http://slideserve.com)\) or a set of real slides from a different presentation that are nonsensical when assembled together, or slides that are nonsensical on their own \(in some cases created by randomly downloading images from the internet and adding unrelated text\).

### **Running the event:**

* Host on Zoom or any other video calling platform that allows for participants to share their screen easily. 
* Go to [https://www.slideserve.com/](https://www.slideserve.com/) and choose a slidedeck \(ask for topic suggestions or pre-create a list of slides before the event\).
* Share your screen with the slidedeck and ask who wants to present the slidedeck as you, the MLHer, control the slide. 
* Allocate ~2 minutes per presenter 

Note: If participants have their own slidedeck to run, feel free to ask them to share their screen!

# WereWolf

A group of wagons crawl along a path on a dark, starless night. Your caravan master’s constantly scanning the skies for proof he runs the correct course. A single lantern his only protection facing the black of night.

To everyone’s dismay, the skies offer you no guidance in these dark times. Werewolves are on the loose.

Your caravan carries travellers bound for the west fleeing the threat these monsters present. Fleeing what remains of their home in Edmond’s Field… desperately grasping at a clean beginning. The town Seer and Doctor travel amongst you offering a short breath of relief. Though the rumors of a young Witch hiding in your ranks raise your guard once more.

You hear yelling ahead as the caravan stops abruptly. The crowd finds me lying dead mauled by werewolves. They are amongst you. You will travel no further this evening.

### **The Werewolves**

Typically werewolves are outnumbered by villagers 2 to 1. So a game of 6 players would have 2 werewolves. The goal of the werewolves is to decide together on one villager to secretly kill off during the night while posing as villagers during the day so they're not killed off themselves. One by one they'll kill off villagers and win when there are either the same number of villagers and werewolves left, or all the villagers have died. This role is the hardest of all to maintain because these players are lying for the duration of the game.

### The Seer

The Seer, while first and foremost a villager, has the added ability to "see" who the werewolves are once night falls. When called awake by the Moderator, the Seer can point to any of their fellow players and the Moderator must nod yes or no as to whether or not they are indeed a Werewolf. The Seer can then choose to keep this information a secret during the day, or reveal themselves as the Seer and use the knowledge they gained during the night in their defence or to their advantage during the day. The strategy here is up to you.

### The Doctor

Also a villager, the Doctor has the ability to heal themselves or another villager when called awake by the Moderator during the night. Should they heal themselves, they will be safe from being killed by the werewolves, or should they want to prove themselves the Doctor or fear the death of a fellow villager, can opt to heal them instead? Again, the strategy here is up to you.

### The Witch

This role, while first and foremost taking on all the elements of a regular Villager throughout the game, also has the additional powers of one potion and one poison, which they may use at any point throughout the game. When the Witch is added, the Moderator will wake them up separately during the night with, “The Witch comes awake…” and follows this with “The Witch brings someone back to life.” and “The Witch poisons someone.” The Witch will then point to the person they want to poison or bring back to life. While the Witch can only use their potion and poison once, each action must be said each night to retain anonymity as to what has been done. They can only use one per evening until both are gone, and have the ability to save them until a point in the game they deem fit.

## **Running the event:**

### **Script:**

A group of wagons crawl along a path on a dark, starless night. Your caravan master’s constantly scanning the skies for proof he runs the correct course. A single lantern his only protection facing the black of night.

To everyone’s dismay, the skies offer you no guidance in these dark times. Werewolves are on the loose.

Your caravan carries travelers bound for the west fleeing the threat these monsters present. Fleeing what remains of their home in Edmond’s Field… desperately grasping at a clean beginning. The town Seer and Doctor travel amongst you offering a short breath of relief. Though the rumors of a young Witch hiding in your ranks raise your guard once more. 

You hear yelling ahead as the caravan stops abruptly. The crowd finds me lying dead mauled by werewolves. They are amongst you. You will travel no further this evening. 

## **Roles:**

### **Moderator**

* **Overview/Ability:** 1 moderator per game \(typically you, the MLHer\). In charge of story role playing, setting the tone of the game, walking through each of the role's abilities per night.
  * You MUST prompt each role to awaken even if they are no longer active in the game. 
* **How to:** 
  * During each night, all players must "sleep" \(aka close their eyes or turn off their webcam\). One at a time, call awakes by opening their eyes \(in person\) or DMs the moderator with webcam off \(digitally\):
    * The werewolves awaken to uniformly choose who to kill. Werewolves open eyes and point silently \(inperson\) or Werewolves DM moderator their votes \(digitally\). Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
    * The seer awakens and points to or DMs you a person's name, and you must respond with Yes/No if they are a werewolf. Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
    * The doctor awakens and they choose anyone currently alive to heal. They are allowed to heal themselves. Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
    * The witch awakens and can choose to use one of their potions by pointing at someone or DMing their name. Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
  * Day comes, and you must report any deaths during the night. Possible scenarios:
    * "During the night, \_\_\_\_ has been killed by the werewolves"
    * "During the night, \_\_\_\_\_\_ was found limp in the park close to death, but then a mysterious doctor passed by saving them before it was too late"
    * "The witch poisoned/saved \_\_\_\_\_\_"
  * Repeat until the end of the game \(e.g. no more werewolves or if there is one werewolf left with a villager\). 

### **The Werewolves**

* **Overview/Ability**: Typically werewolves are outnumbered by villagers 2 to 1. So a game of 6 players would have 2 werewolves. This role is the hardest of all to maintain, because these players are lying for the duration of the game.

The strategy here is up to you.

### **The Doctor**

* **Overview/Ability**: Also a villager, the Doctor has the ability to heal themselves or another villager when called awake by the Moderator during the night.
* **How to:** Moderator call on them after the Seer and choose who to heal per night. Should they heal themselves, then will be safe from being killed by the werewolves, or should they want to prove themselves the Doctor or fear the death of a fellow villager, can opt to heal them instead. Again, the strategy here is up to you.

# Build Your Leadership Team



Every first-rate hackathon has an exceptional leadership team behind it. When selecting yours, think like a startup CEO: choose enthusiastic and smart people with complementary skills. Here’s what a hackathon leadership team looks like:

* Head of logistics — books venue, develops and runs schedule, orders services and supplies
* Head of finance — secures sponsorships, makes sure vendors get paid, and manages the cash flow and budget.
* Head of marketing — promotes event. In charge of marketing strategy, website, social media, etc.
* Head of hacker experience - this could be the responsibility of another member of the team, but it is extremely important to have everyone in your organization thinking about how to create the best possible hacker experience at your event.

## MLH Tips

* To avoid confusion and increase efficiency, make _one person_ responsible for each category of deliverables.
* To accurately track progress, encourage transparency among team leaders. Consider creating a status spreadsheet that each person can update on a daily or weekly basis.

# MLH Organizer Event Fulfillment

For those of you looking to give hackers physical swag after your digital events, Major League Hacking has a couple of options to help! We are able to utilize our regional fulfillment centers, one in Missouri, one in the United Kingdom, and one yet to be determined in APAC, to send swag out in bulk. This allows us to be able to offer you ways to include your materials and at either no cost or at affordable rates.

MLH will pay for all of the costs associated with shipping and fulfilling the MLH swag, but we'll invoice your team for any additional costs to ship your event's swag. We have full transparency regarding our costs versus yours.

We are able to send:

* Stickers
* Tee shirts
* Prizes
* Various forms of swag.

We are **not** able to ship:

* Perishable items such as snacks
* Anything else that requires time or temperature sensitive delivery.

We would get final confirmation from you and your team before sending out combined materials. If we need to invoice you, the MLH Operations \(Ops\) team will send you a quote based on what our fulfillment centers shipping quotes are, how many hackers will be sent swag, etc.

In all of our options, there will be additional forms we would require you to fill out. You can find a [sample here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUQUh-dThm9lh2TuG-jjpGeaUyxMoVvC5Rdx-N-St7g/edit#gid=0). If you have any questions, need additional context, or have other Logistics questions, please reach out to MLH Ops at ops@mlh.io

Now onto the offerings!

## Option \#1: Envelopes to Hackers

**Description:** You can [find a video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/610058917?t=2h28m54s) of Ryan from MLH opening a sample envelope from WinHacks! We will give an envelope to every hacker who participates in an MLH member event regardless if you send us anything, so this is a great way for you to include some of your event’s or sponsor’s stickers.

**Constraints:** The total weight of the envelope cannot exceed 1 ounce. A household equivalent of this would be the weight of six sheets of printer paper. Also, the materials must be able to fit inside of a 4x9” envelope. Please [see the video link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/610058917?t=2h28m54s) for a reference of what stickers we currently send in the envelopes.

**Cost to you:** As long as the total envelope weight doesn’t exceed 1 ounce, none!

**This is our recommendation if you:**

* Are sending low volume swag such as stickers, post cards, or flyers
* Want a low lift option as this process is fairly hands off
* Are looking for our most budget-friendly option

## Option \#2: Combined Fulfillment using MLH Centers

**Description:** Your team would let us know what materials you intend to send to hackers, which the MLH team will review and give feedback. Once everything is reviewed, you would send your swag to one of our regional fulfillment centers, based on hacker locations. They will then combine MLH materials with yours, and ship it out.

**Constraints:** Barring any shipping restraints, none. We have experience shipping to almost every continent and dozens of countries. With enough heads up, our fulfillment centers can take in large amounts of product, so total size/weight is not a concern.

**Cost to you:** This is more variable than our letter offering. It ultimately depends on what you plan on including in your portion of the shipment. Some factors to consider are:

* **Weight:** As the weight of the package increases, the shipping costs will increase proportionally. For reference, the materials MLH will provide have been pre-weighed to be roughly 8 oz or 250 grams.
* **Dimensions:** Shipping companies charge via dimensional weight if it is greater than the actual weight of the shipment. We ship via FedEx, so we recommend using [their calculator](http://www.fedex.com/in/tools/dimweight.html). Our fulfillment center will always pack in the smallest possible size container, but be mindful if you have irregularly sized or spacious materials.
* **Fulfillment Time:** If you have 50 unique pencils which need to be packed individually, this will increase the time it takes to pack. This is less tangible than the former two factors, but still worthwhile.

**Reference of Initial Costs for MLH Materials:**

|  | **US** | **UK** | **Mexico** | **Canada** | **India** | **Spain** | **Korea** | **Notes** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US** | $4.70 | N/A | $24.27 | $21.00 | $30.00 | $30.96 | $26.66 | 8 Oz Bubble Mailer |
| **UK** | N/A | $4.76 | $12.41 | $12.41 | $12.41 | $7.57 | $12.41 | 250g Large Letter |

As these are the costs for MLH swag, we would be subtracting these costs from each shipment. So if the total shipping costs for a US to US shipment is $7.70, we’d subtract MLH’s swag cost of $4.70 and charge you \(the organizing team\) $3 per shipment.

Finally, if your team wants to send out 500 individual swag shipments to hackers, MLH would invoice your team for a total of $1,500.

**This is our recommendation if you:**

* Want to send hackers larger swag items like tote bags, shirts, etc.
* Have time to work with MLH Ops before and after your event to ensure timely shipping
* Have a dedicated fulfillment budget with some flexibility for customs/fees

Please reach out to [ops@mlh.io](mailto:ops@mlh.io) with any questions regarding fulfillment or shipping of your event’s swag!

================================================
# Streamyard

Streamyard is the service MLH uses to stream to Twitch, Facebook, and Youtube simultaneously. You can control graphics, layouts, and invite hackers to stream with you. All from the browser.

## **Creating A Broadcast**

* Hit the Create a Broadcast button
* Select which platforms you’d like to stream to (typically all of them)
* Give your broadcast a title that will stand the test of time
  * “Marbles” is not a good stream title
  * “Hack at Home Marble Races” is a better stream title
* Include a few sentences of description and whatever logistical information you need to in the description
* Only use schedule for later if you want hackers to see that we’ll be live at a specific time

## **Pro Tips**

* Use a wired internet connection when possible
* Make sure you’re in a quiet environment
* Get familiar with Streamyard before going live the first time

# Emailing Your Sponsors Cheat Sheet

| **What should you include?**                                               | **Why?**                                                                                                                                       | **Example**                                                                                                                                                          |

| <p><strong>Details about the event: size, location, dates</strong><br></p> | These essential details will be some of the first things a potential sponsor is looking for                                                    | LoonHacks will be taking place on April 8-10th at Example University. We expect over 500 hackers this year!                                                          |
| **Overview of what a hackathon is**                                        | Remember that your audience might not be familiar with what a hackathon is! It’s important to give some context in case they’re not familiar.  | A hackathon is a weekend-long invention marathon where High School and College students from the New York City area will spend the weekend building awesome projects |
| **Something Personal**                                                     | Remember that your audience might not be familiar with what a hackathon is! It’s important to give some context in case they’re not familiar.  | I see that you’ve been working with blockchain integration! We are really excited about a blockchain track we’re incorporating into our hackathon!                   |
| **What makes your event unique**                                           | Some sponsors will be receiving a ton of requests to sponsor hackathons. Briefly tell them why your event is special!                          | As the largest female-centric event in the east, we strive to provide a space to encourage female and non-binary hackers that they belong in the tech community.     |

# Understanding your sponsors



## Who They Are, What They Want, And How They operate

You’ll be targeting five types of sponsors:

* Financial — Cash for services. Most sponsors fall into this category.
* Presenting — Sponsors that co-host or co-brand your event. \(Be careful not to give up too much control here.\)
* Anchor brands — These companies make you legit in the eye of other sponsors.
* Strategic partners — Sponsors that help with marketing and promotion; often publications.
* In-kind — Donor companies. They can contribute hardware, t-shirts, etc.

Sponsors support hackathons for three primary reasons:

* To get real time feedback on their development products, especially APIs
* To raise awareness \(or change the perception\) of their brand
* To recruit interns and full-time employees, especially during the fall

Sponsors’ top practical concerns:

* Cost per attendee — sponsors want this to be low, while you want this to be as high as possible while keeping their support.
* Attendee value
  * Are your hackathon’s attendees a good fit for the company in terms of recruiting, marketing, etc.?
  * How hard is it for companies to reach this audience without your help?
* Who else is sponsoring?
  * Depending on the sponsor, your other backers matter. Some companies prefer to sponsor events their competitors sponsor, whereas others want to ensure they’re the biggest name on your roster.
* Package Value
  * Are they getting their money’s worth?
* The Force \(a.k.a.\) their gut
  * How do the sponsors feel about your competency: is the event well-organized so far? Have you been professional in all communications?

## MLH Tips

* Keep mind the person you’re talking with is often not the person who makes the final sponsorship decisions. Make sure all materials you send are as clear as possible to ensure decision makers have enough information to say yes without taking time to contact you.
* Many company budgets are quarterly. Q1 and Q4 are often the best times to get money because budgets are more flexible.

# MLH Community Values

Through supporting hundreds of hackathons around the world and working closely with the MLH Community, we’ve come up with the following Core Values that MLH and MLH Member Events share.

MLH Member Events serve as examples of excellence to other hackathons and communities around the world. By following these Core Values, they set an example of excellence and help create the highest quality experience possible for hackers, organizers, and sponsors alike.

## MLH Member Events set a standard of excellence for attendees.

* Have a **confirmed date and location** that attendees can depend on.
* Events must be **at least 24 hours** and the **venue must be available for attendees overnight**.
* Have **enough food on-site** to reasonably feed attendees during the event.
* Events should **provide healthy food options** and have options available for hackers with dietary restrictions.
* Ensure that **participants own any intellectual property** they produce at the event.
* Clearly **communicate** any major changes to the event (Ex. venue, location, schedule, theme, etc.) as soon as they occur.
* **Check in all attendees** as they arrive at the event and make sure they have an up-to-date name, email, mobile phone number, and school for each of them.
* Have **at least one lead organizer** who has full ability to make decisions on-site at any time during the event.

## MLH Member Events are open and accessible to all students.

* **Do not have entry fees**.
* **Advertise well** enough in advance for hackers in the area to learn about the event.
* **Do not discriminate** on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, economic status, veteran status, disability, or age.
* **Aren’t secret** or invite-only event&#x73;**.**
* Have a straightforward and publicly known **general application process**.
* Publish the **criteria for admission** to their event.
* Publish the **rules and regulations** for competing in their event.

## MLH Member Events are fair.

* **Organizers don’t compete** in any event they are organizin&#x67;**.** They extend the same rule to judges, sponsors, and other staff.
* Are **open to hackers who are students** at the time of the hackathon or who have graduated within the last 12 month&#x73;**.** Students can include high school students, university undergraduate, postgraduate students, and people who are in vocational training such as apprenticeships. They welcome non-students as volunteers, mentors, sponsors, and judges.

## MLH Member Events are safe and welcoming spaces.

* Adopt, make available, and enforce the [**MLH Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
* All **organizers sign and agree** to the MLH Code of Conduct.
* Have a clear and widely known **reporting system for incidents**.
* Have a link to the Code of Conduct on their website and ask **all registrant to agree** to the Code of Conduct during registration (e.g. a compulsory checkbox).
* Make it clear that the **Code of Conduct extends to all attendees**, including hackers, volunteers, organizers, sponsors, judges, mentors, and MLH staff.
* Make sure that bad actors and attendees who violate the Code of Conduct or rules will not attend the event.
* **Respect and enforce the drug and alcohol laws** and customs of the local country and only allow moderate alcohol consumption in locales where drinking is allowed.
* Have a **first aid kit** on-site during the event.
* If minors are attending, the **child safeguarding** requirements for the region/state have been met.
* Whenever possible, events **provide sleeping spaces for attendees** and encourage attendees to take advantage of them.

Creating an empowering environment where hackers of all skill levels can create amazing things is MLH’s main priority. The MLH Community Values codify this belief in a way that describes not only the MLH Member Events but also the types of events that MLH wants to work with because of their positive contributions to the student hacker movement.

# What is MLH?

Major League Hacking (MLH) is the official student hackathon league. Each year, we power over [200 weekend-long hackathons](http://mlh.io/events) that inspire innovation, cultivate communities and teach computer science skills to more than **65,000 students** around the world. MLH is an engaged and passionate maker community, consisting of the next generation of technology leaders and entrepreneurs.

At Major League Hacking, our goal is to give you the tools to throw the best hackathon humanly possible, which is why MLH Member events get various benefits like:

* Mentorship and Support
* Templates and Tutorials
* Preferred Vendors and Discounts
* Onsite Hackathon Support
* Mini-Events
* Judging Support
* Prizes
* Software Lab

(You can see the full list [here](https://mlh.io/event-membership). )

The sooner your hackathon applies for membership, the more time you’ll have to take advantage of all MLH benefits. To [apply](https://mlh.io/event-membership), it must be _at least_ 3-4 months before your event.

Throughout your planning process, you will be supported by a Hackathon Community Manager (HCM) from MLH to help answer any questions, talk through challenges, and brainstorm new ideas.

During your event, an MLHer (called a Coach) will be on-site to help you and your team with whatever you need. MLHers are event organizers themselves and receive extensive training to become an asset to your team.

# What is a Hackathon?

Hackathons are an incredible way to bring your community together to learn new skills, build amazing projects, and share ideas. A hackathon is best described as an **“invention marathon”**. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science!

MLH Presents: What is a hackathon?
{% endembed %}

If you're familiar with in-person hackathons and are curious about how the fundamentals translate to the digital space, we've outlined some of the key differences and our recommendations [here](event-types/digital-events/).



================================================
FILE: overview/event-types/README.md
================================================
# Event Types

MLH's Hackathon Organizer Guide is designed to make sure that the first time hackathon organizers and even the experienced ones, all get something out of it. We tried to formulate all the best practices we have seen over the years into a single guide that can help anyone who wants to put together an awesome event, with or without MLH's direct support. This includes information for 2 main types of events, In-Person and Digital. You can find Digital Specific Resources [here](digital-events/).

An **In-Person event** requires everyone be at the location of the event for judging. It may have "digital" aspects (streaming workshops due to limitations of the workshop room size, having a communication platform like Discord for announcements, etc) but the majority of the event will take place in person. Hackers are free to come and go (common if they live nearby), but every hacker shows up in person for check-in and judging. There is no shipping of swag/prizes after the event because they are given out that weekend. Food/Snacks and a venue exist for an in-person event.&#x20;

A **Digital event** can be global. While it may be marketed towards certain schools near the host, anyone with an internet connection can participate within the timeframe of the event. These often have videos used for judging, or have a room setup for each team in Discord for live judging, but there is no in-person aspect for food/judging. If shipping/prizes are limited to a certain country the FAQ on the hackathon website and rules on Devpost should clearly state limitations.&#x20;

We will be prioritizing partnering with In-Person Events this season to make sure we have the greatest impact possible with the resources we have available. Digital events are still a great resource, and we have included information in this guide to help you as you plan, but we will not be able to partner with you for the 2024 Hackathon Season.&#x20;

We will not be working with hybrid events, and want to warn that we have seen historically that hybrid events are worse for both organizers and hackers. Organizers struggle to coordinate two events simultaneously _(a well run digital hackathon is more than just a Discord!)_. Running an in person event while juggling a Discord can stretch your team very thin. Digital hackers end up feeling left out at hybrid events, and have a less impactful experience.&#x20;

Some examples that make hackers feel left out with Hybrid events:

* An in person workshop runs late and virtual participants are not notified of the schedule change to accommodate. Or certain workshops are in-person only due to AV issues. Or the AV is hard to hear, at a bad angle, or does not interact with the virtual attendees.&#x20;
* Delay in communication to virtual attendees on check-in process because the team is busy checking in people in-person
* Less digital engagement than in-person due to limited time in the schedule. We often see more in-person side activities than digital.
* Virtual participants get less interactions with sponsors who are prioritizing their in person table.
* Judging being felt as inconsistent/biased because virtual participants can not answer questions like the teams in person doing a science fair style presentation.
* Judging is run as fully digital despite the majority being in person. Most hackers prefer in person judging over making a video, but some events judge only by video.
* Swag only being for in person attendees- Sponsor and event swag.&#x20;
* Some virtual attendees gave feedback that they would have liked to have Uber Eats code or similar for food. While this would not be feasible for most event budgets, it is another aspect that feels unfair for the different attendees.&#x20;
* More giveaways in person than digital
* Collaborating across digital vs in person can be difficult.&#x20;
* Prizes/swag being shipped and also given out in person can be harder to track and fulfill

These do not encompass all of the issues we have seen, but are just a few of the more common items that make a hybrid event less impactful.&#x20;

We want your event to focus on being the best event possible for your attendees. This might mean having a smaller in person event you can fully support, but you can use that to grow each year to a larger event size. There are alternative events available for those who can only participate virtually, we encourage you to focus on making the biggest impact you can for the hackers you have at your event.&#x20;

# Digital Events

We have consolidated some Digital Event Specifics here.&#x20;

First, let us go over some differences between a Digital and In-Person Event.&#x20;

| Event                         | Digital                                                                                                              | In-Person                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Check-in**                  | Checkin using an online form                                                                                         | In-person check-in process                             |
| **Opening Ceremony**          | Pre-recorded, watched on a live stream, viewable anytime                                                             | Live presentation, seen once                           |
| **Workshops**                 | Live-streamed, viewable anytime                                                                                      | Live presentation, seen once                           |
| **Meals, Snacks, and Drinks** | Hackers provide                                                                                                      | Organizers provide                                     |
| **Mini-events**               | Online multiplayer games, trivia tournaments, and more                                                               | Cup stacking, trivia, video game tournaments           |
| **Swag**                      | Shipped to hackers after the event                                                                                   | Hackers collect swag bag at check-in                   |
| **Hacker Interactions**       | Via Discord or Slack across all attendees                                                                            | Via Discord or Slack, or In-person with hackers nearby |
| **Sponsor interactions**      | Hackers join office hours dedicated for the sponsor                                                                  | Hackers approach sponsors at their tables              |
| **Judging**                   | Pre-recorded demos submitted on Devpost, available to view after submissions, or live demos in channels like Discord | Live demos                                             |
| **Closing Ceremony**          | Streamed pre-recorded videos by organizers, viewable during and after the event                                      | Presented live by organizers, with sponsors on stage   |

## **Digital** Sponsorship

Getting sponsorships for Digital Hackathons is much different from an In Person one. This is because sponsors have different goals from different kind of events. Also, **a digital hackathon can be organized for a fraction of the cost** of an In Person hackathon.

Digital events have significantly lower costs compared to in-person events. This is because the costs of food, lodging & venue which take up a significant chunk are removed. Though the addition of shipping might add to the costs, this too can be greatly reduced with judiciously planning the distribution.

With the **right communication and target**, you can expect a lot of positive response from the sponsors' side even for a digital hackathon. However, be diligent to communicate with your sponsors at every step of the process. Explain to them the **reasons** for making your event digital, outline how you will **support them** throughout the event, and let them **know about the success** at other digital events.

* As we have noticed with time, **sponsors can get much of the same value** from a Digital Event as they can an In Person one.&#x20;
* **Prize categories** and **Workshops** can both be run much the same, though sponsors should practice running their workshop through streaming or pre-recorded video.&#x20;
* Give sponsors their **own channel on the chat platform (Slack/Discord)** to talk to hackers, and have them introduce themselves so everyone knows who they are how they can be a resource for them. As long as they’re online answering questions from hackers about their company/prize category/workshop/anything else they’re doing that weekend, they’ll have a lot of great interactions with hackers.&#x20;
  * _For digital events set up Google Hangouts or Zoom breakout rooms for your hackers to meet companies one on one, similarly to how they would at a sponsor fair._
* We also strongly recommend doing **Office Hours** with sponsors.

## Communicating with Hackers

* **Streaming Platform-** for Opening & Closing Ceremonies. _Recommended Platform:_ [_Streamyard_](streamyard.md) _- Streamyard can be used to simultaneously stream to YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook._&#x20;
  * You can edit videos together on YouTube or iMovie (Mac) or just play them sequentially on the stream. If you pre-record your video, we’ve found music and video can make it much more engaging. Make sure to use royalty-free music!
* **Video Calling Platform-** for hosting your workshops, mini-events, live demo judging, webinars etc. _Recommended Platform: Zoom_
  * If possible, encourage folks to turn on their webcams so that everyone can see each other. There may be some attendees who don’t have the bandwidth to connect with video. That’s okay! You may even have some attendees who join without access to a computer. If so, consider asking someone to cast their desktop so folks can follow along or cast your own.
  *   Make sure you choose a platform that will allow for the correct number of attendees.

      Some popular options are:

      * [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206618765-Zoom-video-tutorials)&#x20;
      * [Google Meets](https://apps.google.com/meet/how-it-works/) (allows for up to 100 participants)&#x20;
      * [Google Hangouts ](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/2944865?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\&hl=en)(allows for up to 25 participants using video)
      * [Discord Video Calls ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000982752-Screen-sharing-Video-Calls)
* **Virtual Conference Platform-** can be used for running the whole event in a consolidated space. These platforms are a bit costly but the hacker experience they provide is much better than using different streaming and calling platforms. _Recommended Platforms: Hopin, Gather.Town_

## Budgeting for Digital Events

* Distributing swag in a digital world might look a bit difficult as the costs of shipping are associated with them. We would recommend you to look at the different options available which can be easily fulfilled from your side within a budget. We recommend using the local postal services (like USPS or Indian Post) as they often are the most reliable & economical shipping providers.&#x20;
  * Utilizing too much money into the shipping and fulfilment of swag and prizes in a digital event is not valuable as it might be for an in-person event. Use your best judgement when it comes to how much to spend on swag for a digital event
  * If you don’t have the budget to ship everyone something for a digital event, you can send a package to each university club that participated and have them handle the distribution. That should keep shipping (and labor) low, while letting you allocate your budget toward something high-impact.
  * Keep in mind however you’re shipping, this doesn’t need to happen directly after your online event. We encourage you to take a few days off to rest and recover before you start the shipping process. Alternatively, you can send out swag to arrive before the event starts so hackers can post on social media and generate hype.&#x20;
* For Digital Events we recommend checking for prizes that can be easily fulfilled with free delivery through Amazon or any other online service.&#x20;

## Digital Attendance and Engagement

_Since hackers do not need to make travel arrangements to attend a digital hackathon, you will likely see **sign-ups rising closer to the event** start that you may see at in-person events. The exciting part of this is you now have the ability to promote your event to hackers anywhere in the world!_

Checkout our [example check-in form](https://majorleaguehacking.typeform.com/to/HxLpsQjl) as a reference to what information you might need to collect day-of. If you are sending swag, shipping address is important to gather during registration and/or check-in.&#x20;

### Digital Check-ins

It is still important for Digital Events to have a check-in process. Examples include Discord bots, Google forms, and Typeform. If you have a separate registration platform, building in a small check in button that reveals all the day of information and links is a great way to get this done.

### Digital Engagement

In a physical event, you can quickly communicate with people in the same room as you. However, at a digital event, you’ll need to set up an environment so that people feel comfortable starting conversations as they would in-person.

Having a chat channel like Slack/Discord is essential. Creating separate channels for groups, teams, and interests would be the first step. We also suggest your organizing team to be active on these platforms to help facilitate conversations, moderate threads and get people chatting. This also makes your hackathon more accessible for people who have a hard time in large groups.

## Digital Judging

You can follow our Judging process later in the guide, but some important differences for digital events have to do with how hackers how off their projects, and how Devpost classifies Digital Events.&#x20;

Live Judging: If you are doing a digital event, we recommend making a discord voice channel for each team (Team 1, Team 2...., Team 50). Hackers can wait in the call then screenshare/join video as judges join the channel.

Devpost: Since hosting Digital Hackathons is a paid service on Devpost, you need to contact their support for conversion of your in person hackathon into a digital one from their side. Devpost people are kind enough to provide their platform for free for any community/ student hackathons that might be happening around!

## Digital Day-Of

Last but not least, here is a quick reference check-list for items you want ot ensure happen day-of:&#x20;

* [ ] Check-in is ready and up (You have all the information you might need later on)
* [ ] Streaming platform is ready to go
* [ ] Opening ceremony ready to go&#x20;

# Streamyard

Streamyard is the service MLH uses to stream to Twitch, Facebook, and Youtube simultaneously. You can control graphics, layouts, and invite hackers to stream with you. All from the browser.

## **Creating A Broadcast**

* Hit the Create a Broadcast button
* Select which platforms you’d like to stream to (typically all of them)
* Give your broadcast a title that will stand the test of time
  * “Marbles” is not a good stream title
  * “Hack at Home Marble Races” is a better stream title
* Include a few sentences of description and whatever logistical information you need to in the description
* Only use schedule for later if you want hackers to see that we’ll be live at a specific time

## **Pro Tips**

* Use a wired internet connection when possible
* Make sure you’re in a quiet environment
* Get familiar with Streamyard before going live the first time

# Hacker Hangouts

Hacker Hangouts are a great way to meet other people and mingle. It’s hard to bump into someone and spark a conversation digitally, so we created this event to foster those moments of social interaction!

## **You will need:**

* Access to Zoom and breakout rooms
* Appointed captains for the breakouts
* A list of questions

You will break hackers up into groups of three. As soon as you get three hackers, have someone volunteer to be a captain, or pick someone, and then break them off. Keep repeating until you are out of friendos.

Three is the sweet spot because it’s small enough to make sure everyone participates, but not as intimidating as one on one. Also, your questions will say five or ten minutes, but those are mostly suggestions.

## **Share these rules with hackers:**

1. Avoid talking about Coronavirus or related topics. Not only is much of our day to day involving it, it’s important to have a space that doesn’t include it in any way, shape, or form.&#x20;
2. Each group will be assigned a captain. The leader’s main responsibility is to make sure everybody in the group participates.
3. Once the new topic is given, you must move on. If you find yourself not wanting to move on, that’s great but you still gotta go to the next talking point. Talk to them about it afterwards!
4. Be respectful of others. Give them time to talk and share their opinions, thoughts, etc. It’s essential to give everyone a safe space so that everyone feels encouraged to participate.&#x20;

## **Pro tips for making questions if you need to:**

* Start off light, and end on a positive note. The middle question can be deeper and more introspective, but we want open participatio&#x6E;**,** so avoid sensitive topics.
* Also, avoid questions with discrete answers. Instead of asking, “what’s your favorite movie,” try to ask people to tell you stories about times they went to a movie theatre
  * You can always do an, “and why?” if you want to run a “favorite” question.
* Try to be on brand with the event you’re at! For example, Hack Girl Summer’s questions should have a different overall theme than Hack the Chain’s

## Some questions to get you headstarted:

* What are the books/movies/games/videos that never get old and always make your day a little brighter?
* What platitude do you think is bullshit? What platitude do you think holds truth? (Think, "love conquers all," or "when life gives you lemons...")
* Assume you have a lot of musical talent. If you started a band, how many people would be in it and which position would you be? What would you name it? What genre would you play?
* If there was a biopic about you, who would star in the movie of your life?
* What’s one common misconception about you? What’s one assumption about you that’s typically right?
* What was the best year of your life?
* What was your favourite thing or memory about the place you grew up?
* What have you been meaning to do but haven't yet done? Why haven't you done it?&#x20;
* What is something you’ve done/felt/seen/experienced that you wish you could do again for the first time?
* What is a perfect day for you?
* Tell us about a good friend, and either a memory you have with that person or something you admire about them.
* In the movie \*Inside Out\*, each person has a set of "core memories" that define who they are and how they behave. What's one of yours?

# Marble Races

## You will need:

* A Windows machine (Check the store page for marbles for minimum specs)
* Streamyard
* A microphone and commanding voice

## What is this?

Marbles on Steam is a free game where viewers of a twitch stream can hop in and put their name on a marble. The marbles race through a track with no input from the players. It’s very silly and not skill-based at all.

* Install Steam, if you don’t have a Steam account.
* Download Marbles on Stream.
* Log in to your Twitch account on Marbles.
* Click on the Race button to start a race. Once there, simply select “Random” to have it pick a random track.

* Boot up Streamlyard and stream the game through it
* Once the map loads, tell the folks in the chat to type “!join” to join the race as a marble. No other commands work, and they don’t have any input on the game.
* Important: Stream delay is pretty large. Expect at worst 100 seconds between what you say and it appearing on stream.
* Begin the race once a significant portion of your viewers have joined. Control the camera using the WASD keys, and use Left Alt to display all the names of your marbles. Follow them around the track and provide fun commentary!
* Run the game 3 or so times, and whenever you decide to wrap up, hype up your final race by saying it’s the grand finals for marbles at your hackathon. If you can, award them a fun title for their victory in the Discord Channel!

# Pokemon Showdown

## **You will need:**

* A [Challonge](http://challonge.com) account

## **What is this?**

Pokemon Showdown is a way to play pokemon with others for free. We’re playing a format called Gen 8 Random Battles, which is where you’re given a random team of pokemon to fight with. It makes it much more random and silly, so this way almost everyone has a relatively fair shot at winning.

* About an hour before your mini-event, tell your hackers to create an account at [https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) if they’d like to participate.
* Create a google form for your event that asks hackers to write down their discord name and their Pokemon Showdown name. Make sure to link it up to a spreadsheet so you have easy access to the list of members.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UxwroPMACzmCyxmJiNGUrTBYc\_lLVIsP3wS3M-GF2aKLoho7wZNJITiHuoFpOtP4\_25IzA2MOUW99CdLN3dYSVhIPfLzuPoXgKZ7ks823YZVlU2F4l9Jzwt7Yst3krXjo3WlO5ux)

* Make an account over at [challonge.com](https://challonge.com/) and make a tournament bracket for your event. It should be single elimination -- other than that all the other default settings are fine. You can see a sample bracket [here](https://challonge.com/hacklariousPS).
* Once you have the bracket setup, begin collecting signups from your hackers. Cut it off 5 minutes before the tournament start time.
* Add your participants by navigating to the “participants” tab. From there click the “Bulk add participants” option to easily copy and paste your winners in from the sheet for your form.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fg0-m8Hg8Jni3XaUHtmBgJV8\_YU1s3s2H2F3nrKlMjYj9zw\_Tnimzv1cGkhcRRwsOWqWqSawaL3JZvB0msXywQ1P4UkWUCuvUUx7egLmig4r7TOAdrjl1R736OkGACa9CtaUw3sZ)

From there, you can start your bracket. You’ll be given a live link to your bracket that participants can navigate to. Have them reach out to their opponents and begin fighting in pokemon showdown in Gen 8 Random Battles.

\*\*\*\*

* Give your hackers 15 minutes to begin their round 1 match. Non responders get Disqualified. Ask participants to report the results of their matches.
* Proceed down the bracket. Round 1 will have the most troubleshooting -- after that, it’s usually much calmer.
* For your grand finals match, ask your participants to post a link to watch the fight. Repost that link in your hackathon’s announcements with some hype around it, saying it’s the grand finals for the prestigious pokemon tournament!
* Award the winner the Pokemon Master role which you can easily make on Discord.&#x20;

# Wiki Races

## **You will need:**

* Access to Zoom/ Video streaming service
* Any web browser
* Code of Conduct appropriate articles to search for and SFW adjacent articles

## **Wikipedia Races:**

The objective of this game is to try to get to a target **W**ikipedia article as quickly as possible using only links from your starting article and without any searches. To start, the Coach or MLHer staffing the mini event will announce the “finish line”.

For example, let’s say Kevin announces the target article is “Texas Hold ‘Em.” After that, all participants will go to their Wikipedia homepage, and click on the “Random article” link on the left hand side and the races will begin!

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4rDBkTwe\_s8VmrNeTUAy44kZiiSaFzHhOxIKBII0\_nBV2sNXUK0dfjVNi36beevkguISz-43FdFpn7tzx3xYWx-WkYaow-qfR495iHBVPS6s3kYA-AkrBevQObqhYHlqAkHxSlVc)

At which point, you’ll get your starting article:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MR4G2ZQegF2MUKzo7GEr\_PH6GH6xFyD5TwksebCmQEYbAbdFKrYBv0iP0jVBKi6R0npi26FS2aoMNHiexSM2uQqCxwmUrNFjkizJUlWPzS9R8L0Xfr0CfeS0Nh5pl-qHY4fjI1jd)

And after many control f’s and several clicks, we got to the endpoint!

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8CwnLhQyKENbDDYY4wdAjMZgGB7F7N7NnuOr-r-soMnvB2TQgLOFKsFi6k\_tySiWqJytWq4mvefus5QUzgCno\_fmR6UteY51OZ-WD6xhukx3eOSV8yg3gRo6FPEaDTX0Y\_7OZlH4)

Feel free to repeat the races as many times as time permits, as long as hackers are engaged and having fun.



## **Setup**

* Access to the MLH Zoom (see Coach cheat sheet)
* Access any web browser
* Code of Conduct appropriate articles to search for and SFW adjacent articles

## **Running the mini event**

* Choose a starting and ending article on Wikipedia
* Let attendees try to navigate their way from the start page to the end page in \~5 minutes.&#x20;
* Once a path has been found, ask them to go back into their search history and share with others how they got there.

## **Pro tips:**

* Countries are a very easy first race
* Narrow down to make it harder, such as a celebrity
* If hackers finish at the same time, use # of clicks to clinch tiebreakers
