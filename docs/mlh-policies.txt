# MLH Cheating Response Guide
The following is a guide of actions to be taken in the case of suspected or alleged cheating at a hackathon. To ensure fairness and uphold the spirit of hacking, MLH has a thorough process for reviewing projects when concerns about authenticity arise. 

**Concerns about potential cheating must be handled discreetly.** Please refrain from making public accusations about suspected cheating on Discord, Slack, Reddit, or any other public forum. Public accusations, doxxing, encouraging others to target a team ("brigading"), or "witch hunts" can severely damage the event's atmosphere and unfairly harm individuals, especially if the investigation ultimately finds no evidence of cheating. 

## Contact Your MLHer
If you’re at an in-person event, you should have an MLHer on-site. If you’re at a digital event, your MLHers should be reachable through the event’s communication platform (typically Slack or Discord). Your MLHer is responsible for addressing accusations of cheating and following MLH's procedures. If someone comes to you with a concern, you should politely connect them with your MLHer for further resolution. 

Below are the rough steps that MLHers will go through. 



## Investigation
Your MLHer will review the project in question themselves to evaluate its authenticity. They have additional resources from MLH that they may choose to use if needed (like their on-call staff). They will ask the team questions as necessary, such as those available [in our guide](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/cheating-check). 

Please keep in mind that submission platforms have additional information that may not be available on the public project listing. Extra submission questions not visible to the public may be used for extra context when completing the investigation. 

While the codebase needs to be visible, it can (and should!) protect sensitive information. API keys, database credentials, and similar secrets should be kept out of the repository, typically by using a .gitignore file and environment variables. The core project code, however, must be public. Any attempt to circumvent the review process by hiding evidence (for example, making a repository private that was required to be public) can result in disqualification. This includes making the repository private after the event ends.

## Response 
Your MLHer will make a decision and work with your team to ensure everyone is in agreement about it. They may then choose to hide the project from the submission platform or remove the project from judging. 

Regardless of their immediate resolution, the MLHer will centralize their response by notifying our team at cheating@mlh.io. After MLH does a full investigation, which may involve reaching out to the hacker post-event, MLH may additionally issue a warning or ban depending on severity and history. Hackers who repeatedly cheat or attempt to do so are permanently banned from participation in MLH hackathons. 

If a project is reported post-event and found to be cheating after the investigation is concluded, the hacker/s may be asked to return the prize/s, and a new winner will be picked.

================================================
**TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an MLH Member Event, if the event itself creates an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with an MLH representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.**

Major League Hacking (MLH) stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, and veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but are not limited to sharing sexual images, violent depictions, vulgar language, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 

In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, MLH staff, and anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MLH may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact MLH using the reporting procedures defined below.

MLH representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, hackathon-related social events, hackathon-supplied transportation, and online interactions related to the event.

## Reporting Procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.

By sending information to the general reporting line, your report will go to our incident response team members.

# Community Values

Major League Hacking (MLH) believes that every student on the planet should
have access to high-quality events where they can learn, build, and share
their creations. Through supporting hundreds of hackathons around the world and
working closely with the MLH Community, we’ve come up with the following Core
Values that MLH and MLH Member Events share.

MLH Member Events serve as examples of excellence to other hackathons and
communities around the world.  By following these Core Values, they set an
example of excellence and help create the highest quality experience possible
for hackers, organizers, and sponsors alike.

## MLH Member Events set a standard of excellence for attendees.

 - Have a confirmed date and location that attendees can depend on.
 - Events must be at least 24 hours, and the venue (or an alternative) must be available for attendees overnight.
 - Have enough food on site to reasonably feed attendees during the event.
 - Events should provide healthy food options and have options available for hackers with dietary restrictions.
 - Ensure that participants own any intellectual property they produce at the event.
 - Clearly communicate any major changes to the event (e.g., venue, location,
   schedule, theme, etc.) as soon as they occur.
 - Check in all attendees as they arrive at the event and make sure they have
 up-to-date names, emails, phone numbers, and schools for each of them.
 - Have at least one lead organizer who has the full ability to make decisions on site at any time during the event.

## MLH Member Events are open and accessible to all students.

 - Do not have entry fees.
 - Advertise well enough in advance for hackers in the area to learn about the
   event.
 - Do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, economic status, veteran status, disability, or age.
 - Make a goodwill effort to advertise and make the application for admission publicly available.
 - Are not secret or invite-only events.
 - Have a straightforward and publicly known general application process. 
 - Publish the criteria for admission to their event.
 - Publish the rules and regulations for competing in their event.

## MLH Member Events are fair.

 - Organizers don’t compete in any event they are organizing. They extend the same rule to judges, sponsors, and other staff.
 - Are open to hackers who are students at the time of the hackathon or who have graduated within the last 12 months. Students can include high school students, university undergraduates, or postgraduate students, and people who are in vocational training, such as apprenticeships. They welcome non-students as volunteers, mentors, sponsors, and judges.
 

## MLH Member Events are safe and welcoming spaces.

 - Adopt, make available, and enforce the MLH Code of Conduct.
 - Organizers all agree to the MLH Code of Conduct.
 - Have a clear and widely known reporting system for incidents.
 - Have a link to the Code of Conduct on their website, and ask all registrants to agree to the Code of Conduct during registration (e.g., a compulsory check
   box).
 - Make it clear that the Code of Conduct extends to all attendees, including hackers, volunteers, organizers, sponsors, judges, mentors, and MLH staff. 
 - Make sure that bad actors and attendees who violate the MLH Code of Conduct or rules will not attend the event.
 - Respect and enforce the drug and alcohol laws and customs of the local country, and only allow moderate alcohol consumption in locales where drinking is allowed.
 - Have a first aid kit on site during the event.
 - If minors are attending, the child safeguarding requirements for the region/state have been met.
 - If the event is occurring on campus, organizers will make a good faith effort to involve school administration and/or faculty.
 - Whenever possible, events provide sleeping spaces for attendees and encourage attendees to take advantage of them.

Creating an empowering environment where hackers of all skill levels can create amazing things is MLH’s main priority. The MLH Community Values codify this belief in a way that describes not only the MLH Member Events, but also the types of events that MLH wants to work with because of their positive contributions to the student hacker movement.

**Scoring of APPLICATIONS:**

An employee or contractor of Major League Hacking, or any other person or entity deemed appropriate by Major League Hacking, will be responsible for judging Applications (the “Judge”).

The Applications will be judged according to the following criteria:

0. originality/creativity (25%);
0. technical complexity (25%);
0. adherence to Theme (25%) and
0. practical implementation (25%).

The Application that earns the highest overall score at each Event or series of weekly Events will win. The decisions of the Judge will be final. Applications must abide by the hackathon rules set forth by the Event and Major League Hacking in the [Hackathon Rules] (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/master/standard-hackathon-rules.md). In the event of a tie, the Judge will determine the winner at the Judge’s sole and final discretion. Each Participant or team must be available during the Event’s judging period to demonstrate the Participant’s or team’s Application. Judges may inspect Applications at any time during the judging period. The Sponsor may extend the judging period for any length of time, at the Sponsor’s discretion. If a judge or Participant identifies to the Sponsor a conflict of interest, that Judge will be recused from judging the Application with the conflict and an alternate Judge will be identified as a substitution for the recused Judge. Applications may be subject to a due diligence review at any time for eligibility and compliance with these Terms.

**Ownership of Applications:** Participant represents and warrants that the Application is and will be Participant’s own original work and does not and will not infringe the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any third-party patents, copyrights, or trademarks. Participant hereby agrees not to instigate, support, maintain or authorize any action, claim or lawsuit against the Sponsor, or any other person, on the grounds that any use of a Participant’s Application infringes any of Participant’s rights as the creator of the Application, including, without limitation, trademark rights, copyrights and moral rights or “droit moral.” Each Participant acknowledges and agrees that Sponsor or other Participants or third parties may have developed or commissioned works which are similar to the Application of Participant or Participant’s team, or may develop something similar in the future, and each Participant waives any claims that Participant may have resulting from any similarities to the Application of Participant or Participant’s team.

**Prizes and Awards:** The current prizes and awards are listed on https://hack.mlh.io/prizes.

The odds of winning depend on the total number of eligible Entries received. No cash or other substitution of prizes is permitted, except at the sole option of the Sponsor for a prize of equal or greater value. The Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prizes. Winners are solely responsible for any and all federal, state, provincial, and local taxes, if any, that apply to prizes.

Winners will be notified by the conclusion of each Event and may be required to sign and return an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release within seven (7) days of notification and if applicable will be issued a W-9 tax form. If a selected winner cannot be contacted, is ineligible, fails to claim a prize and/or where applicable an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release is not received within seven (7) days, or if such affidavit is incomplete or modified, the prize may be forfeited and an alternate winner will be selected from remaining valid, eligible Applications submitted in a timely manner.

**Publicity:** Except where prohibited, by participating in the Contest, Participant consents to the use of his/her name, photo and/or likeness, biographical information, entry and statements attributed to Participant (if true) for advertising and promotional purposes, including without limitation, inclusion in Sponsor’ newsletters, Sponsor’ websites, and any of the Sponsor’s social media accounts or outlets without additional compensation.

**Indemnity:** You agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold Sponsor and their parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, Sponsor and agents, including advertising and promotion agencies, and assigns, and any other organizations related to the Contest, harmless, from any and all claims, injuries, damages, expenses or losses to person or property and/or liabilities of any nature that in any way arise from participation in the Contest or acceptance or use of a prize or parts thereof, including without limitation (i) any condition caused by events beyond Sponsor’ control that may cause the Contest to be disrupted or corrupted; (ii) any claim than an Application infringes third party intellectual property or proprietary rights; (iii) any disputes among team members, (iv) any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the prize, or acceptance, possession, or use of the prize, or from participation in the Contest; (v) any printing or typographical errors in any materials associated with the Contest; technical errors that may impair your ability to participate in the Contest; or (vi) errors in the administration of the Contest.

DISCLAIMER. IN NO EVENT WILL SPONSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CONTEST, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT SPONSOR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

**General:** The Contest is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Contest is offered by Sponsor, which are not responsible for (i) late, lost, damaged, incomplete, or misdirected Applications, responses, or other correspondence, whether by e-mail or postal mail or otherwise; (ii) theft, destruction, unauthorized access to or alterations of Applications; or (iii) phone, electrical, network, computer, hardware, software program or transmission malfunctions, failures or difficulties.

Sponsor reserves the right, in their sole discretion, to cancel, modify or suspend the Contest in whole or in part, in the event of fraud, technical or other difficulties or if the integrity of the Contest is compromised, without liability to the Participants. Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant, as determined by Sponsor, in their sole discretion. These Terms are governed by the law of the State of New York, without reference to rules governing choice of laws. Any action, suit or case arising out of, or in connection with, this Contest or the Terms must be brought in either the federal or state courts located in New York, New York. Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

**Winner’s List:** For a list of winners, send an email message to hi@mlh.io with Winner’s List as the email subject and Event name specified in the body of the e-mail.

# Disciplinary Action Policy
To ensure that Major League Hacking (MLH) sanctioned events are a safe and welcoming environment, MLH and the local event organizers reserve the right to refuse admittance to any individual to an event. This document outlines common reasons that an individual could be refused entrance to an event, the procedure for notifying the individuals and organizers of bans or suspensions, and outlines the appeals process.

In the event of a violation of sanctioning guidelines, Code of Conduct, or other official Major League Hacking regulation or policy, actions will be taken to rectify the issue. These actions will typically include, in order of severity, the following:

- Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in further sanctions
- Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
- Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges that the harasser holds
- Requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
- Banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)

Participants may attempt to appeal Temporary Suspensions and Permanent Bans by submitting a written request over email to incidents@mlh.io with “[Appeal]” in the subject line and attaching relevant evidence.  

## Notification Procedure

Participants who are issued a Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban will be notified in writing via email. The email will include the following information:

- The exact cause for the Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban.
- The length of the Suspension. Bans are permanent.

If an individual attempts to register for a Sanctioned MLH Event that would take place during their Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban, MLH will use the following procedure:

- The participant will be reminded in writing via email that they are not allowed to participate in the event.
- The local event organizers will be notified in writing via email that the individual is currently suspended or banned and should not be allowed to participate in the event.
- The on-site MLH representative will be notified in writing via email that the individual is currently suspended or banned and should not be allowed to participate in the event.

In the interest of privacy, MLH will not disclose the reason for the Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban to the local event organizers unless it is at the individual's request to do so.

Major League Hacking reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please contact MLH by email at incidents@mlh.io.

# MLH Incident Response Guide
The following is a guide of actions to be taken in the case of a Code of Conduct Violation.

## Contact Your MLHer
If you’re at an in-person event, you should have an MLHer on-site. If you’re at a digital event, your MLHers should be reachable through the event’s communication platform (typically Slack or Discord). Your MLHer is responsible for addressing violations of the Code of Conduct and following MLH's procedures. If someone comes to you with a concern, you should politely connect them with your MLHer for further resolution. 

## Contact the MLH Incidents Team
If you cannot contact your on-site MLHer, immediately contact MLH’s Incident Response Team via one of the reporting phone numbers. If you do connect with your on-site MLHer, they will call the incidents team. 

- North America General Reporting - +1 409 202 6060, incidents@mlh.io
- Canada General Reporting - +1 343 453 4532, incidents@mlh.io
- Europe General Reporting - +44 800 808 5675, incidents@mlh.io
- Asia-Pacific General Reporting - +91 000 80004 02492, incidents@mlh.io
- India General Reporting - 000 80004 02492, incidents@mlh.io

Below are the rough steps that MLHers will go through. 

## Ensure Everyone's Safety, Privacy, and Comfort
Our staff prioritizes attendee safety over process when necessary. Beyond that, they will do their best to ensure that everyone's privacy is respected and they are comfortable throughout the resolution process. 

## Initial Report
The on-site MLHer will prepare an initial report of the situation. Depending on the severity/details of the incident, to get this report, the MLHer will follow these guidelines:

- If there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone, including conference staff, is in doubt, summon security or police.
- If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request.
- Offer the victim a private place to sit.
- Explain who they are and ask what happened, so they can help address the situation. 
- Provide them with a list of emergency contacts if they need help later.


The MLHer will try to get as much of the incident in written form from the reporter. If they cannot, they will transcribe it as it was told to them. The important information to gather includes the following:

- Identifying information (name, etc.) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident
- Other people who know of the incident

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

- Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
- Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint, or ask them for input on penalties. This is a staff responsibility. The MLHer on-site will work with the MLH Incidents Team to respond in a consistent way across events. They will keep the local organizing team involved in this process. 

Some things our team can consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders can be found in our [Disciplinary Action Policy](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/disciplinary-action.md).

## Response 
MLH will decide on a course of action with the on-site MLHer and event organizers. Your MLHer will ask the alleged harasser to speak in a private space and summarize the report that was made against them. They will then notify them of MLH’s decision.

If the alleged harasser has a different understanding of the situation, we allow them to give their side of the story, but our course of action will stand until an MLHer says otherwise. 

It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken, while still respecting the privacy of individual attendees. When speaking to individuals (who were aware of the incident but were not directly involved), we will leave out specific details.

Depending on the incident, the MLH Incident Response Team, in coordination with the on-site MLHer, will determine if any public announcements are necessary. While MLHers are the primary communicators for such announcements, there may be specific contexts where local organizers are asked to deliver an announcement. In such cases, this will only occur after close collaboration with MLH on the precise wording and timing.

If attendees express distress or anger about an incident and its handling:
- Acknowledge their feelings and sincerely express regret that their experience was negatively affected by the incident.
- Reassure them that such matters are taken seriously and that appropriate steps are being taken or have been taken, respecting the privacy of those involved.
- If they wish to provide further feedback or discuss their concerns in more detail, offer them clear channels to do so by speaking further with the on-site MLHer when appropriate, or encouraging them to provide written feedback directly to MLH via incidents@mlh.io so their concerns can be addressed.

**Section 2 – Scope.**

1.  **License grant**.
    1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        1.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
        2.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section [2(a)(4)](#s2a4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5.  Downstream recipients.
        
        1.  Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        2.  Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
        3.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
        
    6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](#s3a1Ai).
2.  **Other rights**.
    
    1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
    2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

**Section 3 – License Conditions.**

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

    2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section [3(a)(1)](#s3a1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

1.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section [2(a)(1)](#s2a1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
2.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section [3(b)](#s3b); and
3.  You must comply with the conditions in Section [3(a)](#s3a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4](#s4) supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

1.  **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**

**Section 6 – Term and Termination.**

1.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
2.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section [6(a)](#s6a), it reinstates:
    
    1.  automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [6(b)](#s6b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
3.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
4.  Sections [1](#s1), [5](#s5), [6](#s6), [7](#s7), and [8](#s8) survive termination of this Public License.

**Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.**

1.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

Our tools, templates, and other resources will make organizing a breeze for you and your full team.

This document contains everything you need to know to partner with MLH: common questions, a walkthrough of our benefits, and what we expect from you and your team. If you have questions at any step along the way, please email your personal Hackathon Community Manager at league@mlh.io.

Thank you for everything you are doing and for being part of the hacker community. We can’t wait to see the positive impact your event will have on your hackers’ lives and your local tech community.

Happy hacking,

Swift

_CEO & Co-Founder_

_Major League Hacking (MLH)_

# **Member Event Overview & FAQs**
_This section contains an overview of what MLH Member Events are and common questions about them._
## **What is an MLH Member Event?**
An MLH Member Event is a student-focused hackathon that Major League Hacking has verified as a high-quality event by evaluating the event’s progress in key areas like sponsorship, marketing, hacker experience, and logistics. These events receive MLH’s full suite of resources and tools to ensure attendees have an amazing hacking experience. All Member Events have a trained hackathon facilitator from MLH (called a Coach) on-site throughout the event to help hackers, organizers, and partners be as successful as they can be.
## **Who from MLH will I be interacting with?**
Throughout your planning process, a Hackathon Community Manager (HCM) from MLH will support you and help answer questions, discuss challenges, and brainstorm new ideas. They will also assist you with any after-event assistance needed. You can reach your Hackathon Community Manager at league@mlh.io.

During your event, an MLHer (called a Coach) will be on-site to help you and your team with whatever you need. MLHers are event organizers themselves and receive extensive training to become an asset to your team.

## **When should we apply for Membership?**
We encourage events to start their applications as soon as possible because we have limited Member Event slots available. We typically recommend starting your application 3-4 months before your event is scheduled to occur. Remember, you do not need to have everything ready to start your application. The sooner you apply, the higher your chances of becoming a Member Event Hackathon. Before you apply, make sure to review this document in full. If you have any questions, our team is here to help. Please email us at league@mlh.io.

## **How do we become an MLH Member Event?**
You’ll start with a simple initial application ([that you can probably fill out right now!](https://mlh.link/member-event-application)). After completing your initial application, you’ll have access to our full Member Event Application that you can get started on before your initial meeting with us. The application is broken down into sections on major topics to get to know your team and your current planning progress. When you’re ready, you’ll ‘submit’ your application to our team for review. While we don’t need all the requested documents submitted before your initial meeting with us, looking at what you need to submit beforehand can help you formulate questions to ask during the call.
 
## **What happens after we submit an application to become an MLH Member Event?**
After you submit your application, our team will review your responses to ensure we understand your event and can support it logistically - see our Minimum Requirements Section for more information. If your event has met our minimum requirements and your application has been moved forward, we’ll request a meeting and additional documents from your team so we can complete a document review with one of our Hackathon Community Managers. You and your team earn MLH Member Event Status by submitting all the needed documents and hitting the quality marks we look for in events. After your interview, our team will review your details and also verify that we still have the capacity in the month of your event. We will then let you know the results of your application.

## **What about LLMs/AI at hackathons?**
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools allow hackers to kickstart projects, debug their code, and digest complex topics faster than ever. These tools help hackers build better hacks and allow beginners to reach their goals faster. AI competency will be a core skill for hackers, and we want to encourage our community to learn how to use and leverage these tools. As a result, MLH Member Events must allow hackers to leverage generative AI and LLMs.

## **Can we have exclusive / lock-out sponsorships?** 
Some of your sponsors may ask for exclusivity in a specific broad category, like cloud, blockchain, or AI. If you offer this to one of your local sponsors, you must ensure that your local partner knows that MLH may have global partners in the same categories. 

In our experience, having a global MLH partner that conflicts with a local hackathon sponsor does not impact either party. Further, hackers should be able to try out and compare technologies. Ultimately, your local sponsors will receive benefits that MLH’s global partners won’t (like physical attendance, a table at your expo, speaking opportunities, etc.).

## **Does MLH support digital or hybrid hackathons?**
We are not planning to support hybrid or digital hackathons during our 2026 Hackathon Season. We encourage events considering a digital or hybrid format to just host a physical hackathon instead (if possible).

However, we are still asking digital and hybrid events to complete the [MLH Member Event Application](https://mlh.link/member-event-application). This helps us gauge organizer interest in these events. Additionally, when evaluating applications, we look for events that have consistently applied to work with us, so putting in an application (even for a digital or hybrid event) helps us prioritize your hackathon in the future.

Ultimately, we have limited resources and are focusing on hackathons that we believe have the most impact on hackers (in-person hackathons). In our Hacker Census each year, we’ve consistently seen that hackers struggle to engage with hybrid events on the same level as a fully in-person hackathon. You can still reach out for general hackathon advice and use our public resources, such as our MLH Organizer Guide, but we cannot provide Membership to your event.

## **Can our event have elimination rounds?**
Particularly in APAC and India, we’ve seen hackathons implement shortlists, early feedback rounds, and elimination rounds during the weekend. This results in hackers being eliminated or sent home before the event officially concludes. We believe all hackers should be welcome to stay and hack at the event through the end of the event and closing ceremony. 

If you need to limit the number of hackers who can attend the event in person because of venue restrictions, we recommend having any shortlisting take place online before the event instead of during the event.

## **Can judging happen after the event?**
We require judging to be completed during your event. Some hackathons have postponed judging to complete it digitally via video submissions. This means winning teams aren’t announced until the week following your event. This leaves your event feeling unfinished, avoids live demos, and increases your team’s costs for shipping prizes. MLH Member Events must complete judging and awards on the event's last day (usually Sunday, but occasionally Saturday for Friday-Saturday events).

## **What meals does our event have to cover to qualify for MLH Membership?**
Your hackers need fuel! We need to see a plan of meals that your event will provide and a breakdown of costs in the budget. If your event overlaps with standard meal times, then you need to plan to provide an adequate meal for those times, plus snacks for overnight and in-between meals. Specifically: 
* If check-in starts before 10 AM, lunch is required.
* If check-in starts before 4 PM, dinner is required. 
* If hackers stayed the night prior, breakfast is required.
* If the event ends after 12 PM, lunch is required.
* If the event ends after 4 PM, dinner is required. 

If you need help budgeting, please contact your Hackathon Community Manager for assistance.



# **Benefits**
_By partnering with MLH, you get access to all the following benefits and any additional benefits we roll out throughout the year._
## **Before Your Hackathon**
**Dedicated Support & Mentorship.** Our team of Hackathon Community Managers (HCMs) supports hundreds of Member Events every year. We've helped organizers like you handle all sorts of problems and questions. As a Member Event, you’ll be paired with an HCM who can answer any questions or talk through ideas/challenges via emails and calls. This includes help with figuring out how you want to run judging at your event, organizing your run of show, and any other topics you wish to discuss.

**Organizer Hub.** Meet and collaborate with other Member Event hackathon organizers in the MLH Organizer Hub. You can have a private channel for your entire team with your Hackathon Community Manager, and you’ll also be able to connect with and collaborate with other passionate organizers in public spaces. 

**Peer Groups.** We know how much work goes into putting on a world-class hackathon and how intimidating that can be! Through the MLH Organizer Hub, we’ll optionally connect you with organizers planning events on a similar timeline to form Peer Groups. You can use these groups to learn and discuss topics like fundraising, marketing, and leadership.

**Hackathon Organizer Guide.** All organizers have full access to MLH’s Hackathon Organizer Guide at guide.mlh.io. The guide is packed with information for you and your team to leverage as you plan your event.

**Templates and Tutorials.** As part of the Hackathon Organizer Guide, we’ve created a library of templates and tutorials for all organizers to use while planning and hosting their events. While you don’t need to use our templates, we’ve seen organizers consistently struggle with major topics like budgeting and judging when they try to reinvent the wheel. We’ve created simple templates to help you and your team. You can view all of our templates [here](https://guide.mlh.io/organizer-resources/template-links) (https://guide.mlh.io/organizer-resources/template-links). 

**Hackcon Talks.** Each year we host a conference for hackathon organizers where our community shares their knowledge and experiences with one another. We have a library of past talks from organizers that you and your team can use to learn best practices. You can view some of our favorite talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPDgudJ_VDUeQHDMl_9RfkOYf2JU5cwwl) (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPDgudJ_VDUeQHDMl_9RfkOYf2JU5cwwl).

**Planning Feedback.** To help ensure your hackathon is as successful as possible, we’ll review your core documents and deliverables needed to put on a great event. As part of your Member Event Application, you’ll receive a review and feedback on your website, venue, budget, sponsorship packet, sponsorship list, and marketing plan.

**Event Marketing Promotion.** While the best source of hackers for your event is likely your local community and nearby colleges, universities, and schools, Major League Hacking will promote your event to thousands of hackers through various platforms.
* Season Schedule Listing. We’ll list your event on the official MLH season schedule at http://mlh.io/events. Hundreds of thousands of hackers and sponsors visit this page every year to discover the events they want to participate in.
* MLH Community Discord Promotion. We’ll post in an announcements channel on the MLH Community Discord (with 55,000+ members) to promote your hackathon.
* We also can promote you on our Instagram or other social media upon request once you become a Member Event. Reach out to your Hackathon Community Manager for more information.

**Preferred Vendors & Discounts.** Organizing a great hackathon can be expensive. To help you save time and money, we have vetted and partnered with amazing vendors that offer exclusive discounts and priority access to Member Events. 
* **Pure Buttons** (https://www.purebuttons.com/) - We wanted to ensure our organizers continued to have access to high-quality stickers this season. Our friends at Pure Buttons have your back. If you’re familiar with StandOut Stickers, Pure Buttons is the same company.
  * Continental US. 10% discount plus free shipping on your order.
  * UK, EU, APAC, Alaska, and Hawaii. 15% off the entire order. Shipping costs will vary.
  * Want an even better deal? You’ll receive $125 in credit just for displaying the [Pure Buttons logo](https://static.mlh.io/brand-assets/sponsors/pure-buttons/Pure-Buttons-Blue-Gradient-Logo-RGB.png?_gl=1*539svj*_ga*NDkwMTExMTM4LjE2MzcwNzMzNTY.*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*czE3NDc4NDMxNzQkbzY2MyRnMSR0MTc0Nzg0MzIyMCRqMCRsMCRoMA.) on your website linked to https://mlh.link/purebuttons.
* **Brand Makers** (https://www.brandmakers.com/) - If you’re looking to produce anything from t-shirts to mugs, Brand Makers can help. They are MLH’s preferred vendor for all of our own swag. MLH works with Brand Makers for our Season Tees, scrunchies, hats, tote bags, and more.

**Handoff Call with HCM.** About three weeks before your event, your Hackathon Community Manager will spend time with you to discuss final logistics and action items to ensure you and your team are well prepared.

**Pre-Event Call with Coach.** Every Member Event gets a dedicated MLHer (called a Coach) to work with on the weekend of their event. You’ll get an invitation for a 30-minute chat with them the week of your event. They will discuss any remaining logistics, such as mini-event timing, confirm start and end times, and exchange contact information so you can easily reach each other over the weekend.

**OrganizerHQ (OHQ).** OHQ is a free registration platform you can use for your event. It has our required registration questions built in, and you can add additional questions that your team needs. It has a dashboard to track registrations so you can see how your marketing efforts are progressing, and can be used to reject applicants as needed. It can also easily be exported to a CSV, so you can aggregate and sort your registration information according to your needs. 

**MyMLH Support.** Member Events who utilize MyMLH will receive priority support for setup and troubleshooting from our engineering team. MyMLH is an OAuth API that makes registering for hackathons a breeze for hackers by storing their information in a centralized MLH Database, which allows them to share it easily with multiple events.

## **During your hackathon:**
**Day-of Support.** A Coach from MLH will join you and your team to support you during the hackathon in person as an extension of your organizing team. They can help you with anything you need, like making sure the event runs on time, mentoring hackers, coordinating and judging alongside the event’s organizers, or even practicing the opening ceremony with you. They also have extensive experience resolving conflicts with hackers, sponsors, or even organizing teams.

**Software For Hackers.** As an MLH Member Event, we offer software to every hacker registering for your event. Every hacker who registers for a Member Event gets access to discounts and freebies from our partners through the MLH Software Lab. This includes services like web hosting, credit for free domain names, access to the latest LLMs, and more. Even if your venue has capacity restrictions (meaning all registered attendees cannot come), we can still help them jump-start learning with new software and help them find other future events to attend.

**Hardware for Hackers.** MLH partners with various organizations to bring hardware to a limited number of our North American Member Event Hackathons. Because of shipping costs, we cannot guarantee this benefit to each of our Member Event Hackathons. If you receive a hardware lab, you’ll be asked to provide a volunteer to help distribute items and a table specifically for hardware. Events that do receive hardware from MLH and our partners will receive some assortment of microcontrollers, components, smart devices, and other seasonal items, like Raspberry Pis and Arduinos. 

**Event Photography.** We know how important capturing what’s happening at your event can be. Photos will help you and your team build on your successes from year to year. MLHers will be on-site at your hackathon and will take photos of key event moments. These photos can be shared with your team as requested. Additionally, we hire a limited number of professional photographers throughout the year to capture photos. For this to occur, you must agree to our Content Agreement below.

**Week-Of Emails.** Repeated impressions and reminders are among the most effective ways to ensure your registrants become attendees. Leading up to your hackathon, MLH will email each of your registered hackers, providing them with free domains, cloud hosting credits, and other software benefits. In this email, we also include basic logistics information from your application so hackers know how to get involved. 

**Workshops & Mini-Events.** Your MLH representative will run at least two events during your hackathon (remember to reserve two 30-minute blocks or a 1-hour block before 9 PM local time) to provide a fun or educational break from hacking. Some of our partners work with us to run custom events at hackathons (like showing hackers how to access and set up GitHub Copilot or get started with Google Gemini). When we have partner events, we’ll run those events at your hackathon. If we run partner events, you can also choose to have your MLH representative run an additional event from our non-partnered selection.

**Season and Partner Swag.** Your event will receive assorted swag, like MLH Season tees, season stickers, customized event-specific “I Demoed” stickers, Winner Pins, MLH stickers, and MLH partner swag. Many of our partners send along additional swag that we’ll distribute at the MLH table, like pens and carabiners. Swag availability will vary depending on supply and location.

**Judging Support.** We know that judging is one of the most stressful periods during a hackathon. We offer judging templates, resources, and tutorials for all Member Events to utilize. In addition, our MLH representative can assist you with running demos and judging during your event in a fair, standardized way. You are still expected to recruit and coordinate judges' arrival before the event.

**Incidents Management.** MLH Member Events are safe and welcoming spaces. To do this, we require all attendees, sponsors, and organizers to adhere to the MLH Code of Conduct (http://mlh.io/code-of-conduct). If someone violates the Code of Conduct, your MLHer will work with our full-time Incidents Team to address the situation with you and anyone involved. Our team has extensive training and experience handling these situations, so you don’t have to.

**Cheating Resolution.** While we see far fewer attempts to cheat at in-person hackathons, our team is still ready and able to help you address any concerns following our Cheating Response Procedure  (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/master/cheating-response.md). our on-site MLHer can review projects live or escalate them to our full-time team for more thorough analysis. The registration data you provide to our team will be scanned for any hackers with prior confirmed cheating incidents or Code of Conduct violations.

**Prizes.** All Member Events are provided with special prizes to hand out to hackers. For your event’s overall winners, we provide MLH Winner Pins. We also provide select MLH partner category prizes (http://hack.mlh.io/prizes). MLH will confirm the final prize list with your event during your handoff call before your hackathon. Your team must add our prize list to your submission platform. If your team is using Devpost, we have a partnership to make this easier. As a result, by becoming a Member Event, your hackathon page may automatically include MLH branding and prizes. Devpost may additionally grant us direct access.

**MLH Emergency Budget.** We understand that things you didn't plan for may happen, which creates unexpected costs. To help plan for these instances, your event has the benefit of tapping into the MLH Emergency Budget. This is an up to $1000 (or the currency equivalent in your country or region) fund that can be used for anything your event may need. To qualify for these funds, you must have exhausted your emergency budget and considered other changes to your budget to account for this cost. You’ll also need to work with your MLHer on-site to verify the need.

## **After your hackathon:**
**Post Event Survey.** Anyone who registers for your Member Event will receive a post-event survey about their experience. We’ll share this data with you, as requested, to show you how you compare to other Member Events and identify areas for improvement for your next event.

**Continued Support.** Just because your event is over doesn’t mean your HCM isn’t available to help wrap things up. You still have access to our team, and we are happy to help you with whatever you need to wrap up your event successfully.

# **Requirements**
_MLH was built by passionate community members. To ensure that Member Events are as high quality as the hackathons we fell in love with, organizers must meet the following requirements:_
## **Minimum Requirements**
_We encourage every event to apply for Membership regardless of whether it meets these requirements. We look at an event’s application history when evaluating whether we can work with it. You should apply every year._

**Event Dates.** Your hackathon must occur during the current or upcoming academic year, from July 1st, 2025, to June 30th, 2026. MLH cannot support hackathons the weekend of our annual organizer conference, MLH Hackcon (August 22-24, 2025).

**Free to Attend.** MLH Member Events do not charge entry fees, making them open and accessible to all participants, regardless of their financial situation.

**Primarily Students.** At least 80% of your hackathon’s attendees must be students at the time of the hackathon or have left school within the current academic year. Student attendees can be enrolled at any level of study at a traditional (middle school, high school, university, etc.), nontraditional (coding boot camp, home school, online, etc.) institution, or graduated in the past year.

**Registration Targets & Goals.** We encourage all of our events to be as large as possible without negatively impacting the hacker experience. We do not have a minimum number of attendees required for Membership, but we do prefer to support events with more than 150 hackers that can have more impact. Additionally, we require events to set a registration target. If you are not trending toward your target, your Membership may be revoked and given to a different organization.

**Hackathon Locations.** We are only able to currently support Member Events and their organizers that are based in the regions below. Countries outside of the service areas below will require approval. This shouldn’t stop you from applying, but if you want to be sure, email us at league@mlh.io.
* North America: United States, Canada, and Mexico.
* Europe: United Kingdom, the European Union, and select other European countries.
* Asia-Pacific: India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and select countries in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Australasia.

**Duration.** Member Events are 24 to 48 hours long and occur over a weekend (usually Friday to Sunday or Saturday to Sunday). **Judging and prizes must be awarded at the end of your hackathon on Sunday.** If you plan on awarding prizes post-event, speak with your Hackathon Community Manager.

**Language.** We can only work with events with an English-language website and make announcements during the event in English. If you live in a country where English is not the native language, we encourage you to make announcements and provide information in both languages. We will do our best to assign a team member who is fluent in both English and the other language/s your event is making announcements in. 

**No Elimination Rounds.** We’ve decided not to work with hackathons that leverage early elimination rounds, which require hackers to leave the venue before the event ends. All hackers must be allowed to hack for the same duration of time.

**Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).** MLH Member Events must allow hackers to leverage generative AI and LLMs. 

**Exclusivity.** Some of your sponsors may ask for exclusivity in a specific broad category, like cloud, blockchain, or AI. If you offer this to one of your local sponsors, you must ensure that your local partner knows that MLH may have global partners in the same categories. 

## **Agreements**
We expect you to read and agree to each of the following. By signing below, you agree that you have read, reviewed, and understood each of these sub-agreements. 

**Member Event Guidelines** (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/member-event-guidelines.md) - You’re reading this document! It outlines the things that we need you to do before, during, and after your hackathon and the things we’re doing for you as well.

**Community Values** (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/community-values.md) - This document presents a set of principles shared by every Member Event that serve as examples of excellence to your attendees and sponsors, as well as other hackathons and communities. All Member Events are expected to uphold these Community Values.

**Public Health & Safety Policy.** With large campus gatherings like a hackathon, we want all attendees, organizers, and sponsors to remain safe. We recommend that all events have a clear Public Health and Safety Policy covering unexpected disasters (like COVID-19) that may impact the event. Additionally, you must adhere to the guidelines set by local authorities. MLH reserves the right to change our Health & Safety requirements for Member Events.

**Code of Conduct** (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) - This document contains the guidelines for the expected behavior of all attendees (including volunteers, mentors, sponsors, organizers, judges, etc.) at MLH Member Events. Having a single code of conduct that is used by every hackathon helps us ensure that MLH events are consistently safe and inclusive spaces for everyone and that expectations for behavior and incident response remain consistent for people who attend multiple MLH events. As an organizer of a Member Event, you are expected to adopt, make publicly available, and enforce the MLH Code of Conduct. If an incident is reported, organizers must immediately involve the onsite MLHers or MLH Incidents Team, which will work with you to follow our official incident response procedure.

**Brand License.** We need your permission to promote and list your event on our website, Discord, and other locations. By signing this agreement, you grant MLH an indefinite license to use your event name, branding, and materials to market your event and the season of Member Events. Additionally, we grant Member Events a non-exclusive license to use the MLH name and brand in conjunction with the event. MLH reserves the right to terminate the organizer's license at any time at our absolute discretion.

**Content Agreement.** We love posting photos and videos of Member Events on our website and social media, but we can’t do that without your permission. By signing this agreement, you grant MLH permission to record and publish photos and videos of the event and the right to produce commercial video content (this does not include TV news or sponsor/event recaps). Regardless of your region, you will post a clear notice of photo/recording for participants on your website or at your venue. If you’re in a region that requires additional notification or consent, you will ensure those regulations are followed and MLH is given appropriate rights through those regulations.

**Property Care Agreement.** Member Events recognize that other Member Events will use any MLH property they borrow (hardware, signage, mini-event supplies, etc.). If any supplies are lost, damaged, or late, other events will be unable to utilize them. You agree to see that, to the best of your ability, all MLH property is cared for and returned on time by your hackers, organizers, sponsors, and volunteers.

**MLH Branding Agreement.** On your hackathon’s website, you must display the MLH Season Trust Badge in the header and the MLH logo under your partners section. Hackers and sponsors see the presence of these logos and know that you have achieved the level of quality guaranteed by being a Member Event. These assets are on our official Brand Guidelines page ([https://mlh.io/brand-guidelines](https://mlh.io/brand-guidelines)).

## **Hacker Registration Requirements**
**Attendee Registration Platform.** An event’s registration portal is one of the first points of contact for your hackers. Consistency is key for your new and returning hackers’ experience. Because of this, we require all MLH Member Events to have a registration platform with the following features:
* Hacker Communication. As hackers register for your event, it’s important to communicate any updates or changes to the event via email. The chosen registration platform must allow the event organizers to contact all hackers who are registered through their platform or via export to other platforms.
* Control Hacker Data. All hackers should expect their data to be protected and only accessed by those given permission. The platform must enable organizers to request and receive this permission on their own and/or partners' behalf.
* Add Customizable Opt-In Questions. We require all hackers who attend a Member Event to agree to the MLH Code of Conduct and Event Logistics Information. The platform must allow organizers to add questions that enable organizers to collect opt-in information.

**MLH Checkboxes.** To administer many of our benefits, your hackers must agree to two required checkboxes on your registration form. Additionally, you must include a third checkbox to allow hackers to opt in to marketing from MLH.
* Add our two required agreements to your registration form:
  * [REQUIRED] _MLH Code of Conduct:_ "I have read and agree to the MLH Code of Conduct." (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
  * [REQUIRED] _Event Logistics Information:_ “I authorize you to share my application/registration information with Major League Hacking for event administration, ranking, and MLH administration in-line with the MLH Privacy Policy. I further agree to the terms of both the MLH Contest Terms and Conditions (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/contest-terms.md) and the MLH Privacy Policy ([https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/privacy-policy.md](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/privacy-policy.md)).”
* Add an optional (for hackers) checkbox for the following to your registration form:
  * [OPTIONAL] _Communication from MLH:_ ”I authorize MLH to send me occasional emails about relevant events, career opportunities, and community announcements."
* Are registrations for your hackathon already open?
  * If registrations are already open for your hackathon and you’re planning to work with MLH, you may want to add the following disclaimer to your registration and ensure your registration form meets our requirements.
  * “We have applied to be a Major League Hacking (MLH) Member Event. The following checkboxes are only applicable if our application is accepted. Your information will not be shared if we do not become an MLH Member Event."

**Registration Form.** Member Events must use a minimum set of basic fields and the checkboxes above. This ensures that you, your team, and MLH know who is attending and that attendees know what they agree to. We have both a required and a recommended set of questions. We do not collect, utilize, or share any personal information without an attendee's opt-in.

We’ve outlined these questions in detail in our MLH Organizer Guide at https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/managing-registrations/registration-timelines. Please review this resource to see the exact format of each question and why we need your hackathon’s data in this way.

* Required Registration Questions. We require organizers to gather a basic set of information **(first name, last name, age, email, school name, phone number, country of residence, current level of study, and the 3 checkboxes listed above)**. 
* Optional Demographic Questions. We encourage organizers to ask about additional demographic information in a standardized format. Standardizing your responses using these options allows you to compare your hackathon data to MLH’s Season Census that we conduct each year.

## **Before Your Hackathon**
**Registration Data.** You will regularly submit all registration data to your Member Event Application leading up to your event. Your Hackathon Community Manager will regularly review your marketing and registration progress with you and your team. If your team repeatedly cannot provide registration data, your Membership may be revoked. We further require the finalized list on the Wednesday before your event to look for any repeat violators of the Code of Conduct and send out pre-event emails to your registrants.

**Website.** Hackers, sponsors, and MLH will need a way to find your event and learn more about it. We require that you have a website with the following information: start and end dates, registration forms, general FAQ, and contact information.

**Event Details.** To send our staff and resources to your hackathon, we need you to submit the following information before your hackathon (using our application form): start and end times, venue address and information, package shipping address, point of contact information, and more. You will automatically submit this information by completing your Member Event Application in full!

**Check-Ins With Your HCM.** Your Hackathon Community Manager should be an extension of your organizing team, a resource for both you and your teammates to leverage in tricky situations. We expect you to stay in touch with your HCM about your event’s progress and meet with them periodically as needed to discuss the event. They want to help you stay on track with your goals and see where they can be helpful.

**Venue.** We ask that you either show proof of venue registration or substantial progress toward booking a venue with an estimate of when the venue will be finalized.

**Overnight Accommodations.** We require Member Events to leave their venues open overnight or provide alternate overnight accommodations for any off-campus attendees. Many hackers may travel long distances to attend hackathons and will need a place to rest. If your venue has restrictions on this talk with your Hackathon Community Manager, and we will see about custom exceptions to make sure hackers have what they need while still being able to partner with you. 

**Meals.** We require your event to provide meals for the duration of the event. See the FAQ at the beginning of this document for specific meals required based on your schedule. 


## **During Your Hackathon**
**Hacker Check-Ins.** Your event must have a process for checking in hackers on the day of the event. Collecting check-in information from all hackers will allow organizers to predict mini-event participation, workshop attendance, and project submissions more accurately and utilize this information for the following iteration of your hackathon.

**Check-In Swag.** Allow your MLH representative to distribute MLH swag and promotional items at the attendee check-in area. Distributing these at check-in creates a great first impression and ensures that everyone gets some.

**MLH Table.** Reserve a rectangular table (approx 4x6 feet) for your MLH representative to engage with attendees and distribute swag/credits (stickers, website domains, hosting credit, tee shirts, etc.).  

* MLH Hardware Lab Table.  If you are assigned a hardware lab, you will need to provide an additional table for it. As a reminder, if your event receives a hardware lab, you must also provide a volunteer to facilitate device rentals.

**Opening Ceremony.** Reserve 10 minutes for your MLHer to speak (with slides) during the opening ceremony to share any resources available for your hackers to use during the hackathon and run a live demo. We require that you have an AV setup that allows presenters to plug in their own devices.

**Closing Ceremony.** Reserve 5 minutes during your closing ceremony for your MLH representative to make a few remarks on behalf of MLH and award prizes to the teams that won any MLH partner category prizes. As the overall winners of the event are announced, your MLH representative will help you distribute MLH Winner Pins to each team and take photos of each winning team.

**Signage.** Display MLH Season and informational signage in key areas during the event. Much like displaying the Trust Badge on your website, having MLH signage on-site during the event signals your commitment to hosting a high-quality event and makes your attendees feel like they are part of a larger movement.

**Chat Service.** This allows hackers to communicate with each other, sponsors, organizers, and MLH. We recommend Discord or Slack. 

**Project Submission Platform.** Your hackers must submit their final projects somewhere to be judged and for prize data collection. MLH brings prizes to all of our Member Events on behalf of the sponsors that support us. The project submission platform used during any hackathon must be able to add custom prizes and allow hackers to opt in to submit to prize categories. 

* Submission Platform Field Requirements. Any platform is acceptable as long as your platform has the required fields listed in the [MLH Hackathon Organizer Guide](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/set-up-your-hackathon-portal) 


## **After Your Hackathon**

**Post-Event Call.** After the event, attend a call with your assigned MLH Hackathon Community Manager. We’ll use this time to run a short retrospective on working together, provide feedback, and start planning for future events!

**Event Data.** On the last day of your hackathon, submit all event data to your Member Event Application. We use this data to calculate season rankings and send attendees a post-event survey to collect their feedback. Specifically, you need to include Check-In and Project Submission Data.
* Check-In Data. Submit all check-in data to MLH after check-in concludes. This should be the same data as registration, with an additional column to mark whether they attended. If a hacker is a late registration/walk-in attendee, you should still be collecting their full information. We recommend sending your check-in data during downtime on Saturday night so that you do not have this as a to-do item after your event ends!

* Project Submission Data. Project submissions must include the project’s title, the team members (including their names, emails, & school name), the URL to their project page or code, the project description, any prize categories that the project applied for and/or won, any technologies the project was built with, and any other relevant metadata you’re able to provide. You can see the full list of required fields and an example at mlh.link/projectdata

# Hackathon Rules

These are standard competition rules used at MLH Member Event Hackathons. Not all MLH Member Event Hackathons will use these rules, as organizers can choose to use them or their own. Organizers can use these rules exactly or fork them and edit them to suit their needs. If you have a suggestion for these rules or a question, please email our team at league@mlh.io.

## Spirit of the Competition

Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete, but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Regardless of why you're at a hackathon, ensure you're upholding the hacker spirit and [Community Values](https://mlh.io/community-values) by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.

## Hackathon Rules
1. All participants agree to uphold the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://mlh.io/code-of-conduct) to keep hackathons safe, welcoming spaces for everyone.
2. MLH Hackathons are primarily for students, but may also include professionals. MLH chooses to define students broadly. Anyone who attends a traditional school, college, or university, and those in bootcamps and similar programs are students. Those who graduated within the last 12 months are also considered students. 
3. Organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or anyone in any other privileged position at the event should not participate as a hacker.
4. All team members should actively participate in the event.
5. Teams should leverage advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and each other.
6. All work on a project should be done during the period of the hackathon.
7. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
8. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea, they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
9. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code or other project materials).
10.Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
11. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
12. Your code must be available publicly (ideally in a git repository).
13. Your code must remain public post event to be eligible for prizes. If your repo and video are not public, new winners may be selected.
14. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf), or other unsporting behaviour.

## AI Tools and Code Gen

Artificial intelligence and large language models have dramatically impacted how people create applications and write code. MLH encourages our community to learn these technologies and leverage them. However, it’s essential to continue to follow the spirit of the hackathon. We strongly believe that the best projects will leverage AI, but ultimately be created by humans. 

1. Teams may use AI to assist them while coding, utilizing tools such as code completion, code generation, image generation, or other similar tools. 
2. Teams should be honest and transparent about the AI code tools they used. This includes listing them in their project submissions and answering questions when talking to organizers, judges, and other hackers. 


## MLH Digital Event Submission Rules

For fully digital hackathons that MLH hosts, hackathon submissions are subject to additional rules.
1. We require all teams to submit a 2 minute or less demo video. Your video must be created the weekend of the hackathon. 
2. Your video must remain public post event to be eligible for prizes. If your video is not public, new winners may be selected.
3. Your demo video must state the name of the hackathon at the beginning of the video. Ex. "Hey I'm Sam and this is my demo for CorgiHacks."
4. You must have completed all registration steps for the hackathon.
5. You are allowed to submit your project to other hackathons (taking place over the same period) as long as the other hackathon also allows this.
6. You can not submit a project that includes prior work.

## Demos

After hacking finishes, teams will show their projects to each other and to the judges. Either via a prerecorded video (typically at digital events or live demos at physical hackathons).

You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches and presentations are discouraged. You are not judged on the quality of your pitch or the quality of your idea. As you are judged on what you built, you'll only hurt yourself by not showing a demo.

You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren’t able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack—that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. 

Demoing is not just about the competition. It's a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build—that's what hacking's all about! For being courageous enough to demo, you'll receive an event specific "I Demoed" sticker from MLH. In the case that you don't have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.


## Judging Criteria

Teams will be judged on these four criteria for MLH digital events or MLH categories at an in person event. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

* Technology: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?

* Design: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).

* Completion: Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?

* Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.

These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.

It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:

* How good your code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn't production ready, we're not going to mark you down.

* How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.

* How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning.

* How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!

So don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next big thing. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. Just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day, the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing, but you don't have to do that to win a hackathon.


## Remember!

The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most of the event, try something new, teach others, and make new friends!

Happy Hacking from the MLH team!

## TechTogether Gender Inclusivity Policy

TechTogether events aim to address the gender inequities in the hackathon community and serve people of marginalized gender identities, this includes transgender women, cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, and all gender identities which have been systemically oppressed by those in power throughout history. TechTogether hackathons are only open to people with these identities.

In registration and checkin flows TechTogether events may ask specific questions to determine a participant’s eligibility in the event. After participants answer these questions, TechTogether Organizers will make no further effort to investigate a participant’s gender identity or expression for the purpose of eligibility at the event.

TechTogether welcomes mentors, judges, sponsors, and other supporters of all genders.
